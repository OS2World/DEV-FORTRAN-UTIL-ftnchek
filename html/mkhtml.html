<DD>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Produce HTML documentation from source. Creates individual
HTML files from ftnchek analysis and code comments. All comments
immediately preceding and following the function or subroutine
definition are captured to the HTML file. No reformatting of
source comments is performed other than stripping of FORTRAN
comment characters.  In addition, the HTML file lists the local
variables declared, common block variables used, functions and
subroutines called, I/O unit usage, and other information about each
subprogram.
Usually you will also want to specify <B>-call=tree</B> to create the
root HTML file CallTree.html.  (Perhaps this file should be
named index.html.)
<P>

Various options for the form of the HTML files are controlled
by the <I>list</I>, which consists of keywords
separated by commas or colons.
There are three special keywords: <B>all</B> to turn on all the
options, <B>none</B> to turn them all
off, and <B>help</B> to print the list of all the keywords with a brief
explanation of each.
If <I>list</I> is omitted, <B><A HREF="mkhtml.html">-mkhtml</A></B> is equivalent to
<B><A HREF="mkhtml.html">-mkhtml</A>=documents</B> (i.e. produce the HTML document files
using the default options), and
<B>-nomkhtmls</B> is equivalent to <B><A HREF="mkhtml.html">-mkhtml</A>=none</B>.
<P>

For the sake of simplicity, the options for <B><A HREF="mkhtml.html">-mkhtml</A></B> are the
same as those for <B><A HREF="makedcls.html">-makedcls</A></B> except for those that are
inapplicable.  Likewise,  a numeric
form of this setting can be used, formed as the sum of
the numbers in parentheses in the list below.
The warning keywords with their meanings are as follows:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>documents</B> (1):<DD>
Create the HTML documents.  (This is implied by any of the other
options, and can be omitted if any other options are given.)
<DT><B>compact</B> (4):<DD>
The declarations are normally prettyprinted to line up neatly in
common columns.
This option value selects instead compact output, without column
alignment.
<DT><B>use-continuation-lines</B> (8):<DD>
Causes continuation lines to be used instead of
beginning a new declaration on each line.  This option
is appropriate to use together with <B>compact</B>.
<DT><B>keywords-lowercase</B> (16):<DD>
Output Fortran keywords in lowercase, instead of the default
uppercase.
<DT><B>vars-and-consts-lowercase</B> (32):<DD>
Output variables and constants in lowercase, instead of the default
uppercase.   Character string constants are not affected by this
option.
<DT><B>exclude-sftran3</B> (64):<DD>
Omit declarations of internal integer variables produced by the
SFTRAN3 preprocessor,
<B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1L+xsf3">xsf3</A></B>(1L).

(See <B><A HREF="makedcls.html">-makedcls</A></B> for discussion.)
<DT><B>suppress-array-dimensions</B> (512):<DD>
Suppress dimensioning of arrays in the generated declarations.  This
is normally undesirable, but is available if for some reason you
do not want the array dimensions to appear in the HTML.
<DT><B>free-form</B> (1024):<DD>
Produce variable declarations in free source form.  This mode is automatically
used if the input source is free form.  This mainly affects the form
of continuation lines if they are used.
