<DD>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Controls the degree of strictness in checking
agreement between actual and dummy subprogram arguments that are arrays.
The warnings controlled by this setting are for constructions that might
legitimately be used by a knowledgeable programmer, but that often
indicate programming errors.
By default, all warnings are turned on.
<P>

The <I>list</I> consists of keywords separated by commas or colons.
Since all these warnings are on by default, include a keyword prefixed by
<B>no-</B> to turn off a particular warning.
There are three special keywords: <B>all</B> to turn on all the
warnings about array arguments, <B>none</B> to turn them all
off, and <B>help</B> to print the list of all the keywords with a brief
explanation of each.
If <I>list</I> is omitted, <B><A HREF="array.html">-array</A></B> is equivalent to
<B><A HREF="array.html">-array</A>=all</B>, and <B>-noarray</B> is equivalent to
<B><A HREF="array.html">-array</A>=none</B>.
The warning keywords with their meanings are as follows:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>dimensions</B>:

<DD>
warn if the arguments differ in their number of dimensions,
or if the actual argument is an array element while the dummy argument
is a whole array.
<DT><B>size</B>:

<DD>
warn if both arguments are arrays, but they differ in number
of elements.
</DL>
<P>

For compatibility with previous versions of <B>ftnchek</B>,  a numeric
form of this setting is also accepted: the <I>list</I> is replaced by a
number from 0 to 3.  A value of 0 turns all the warnings off,
1 turns on only <B>dimensions</B>, 2 turns on only
<B>size</B>, and 3 turns all the warnings on.
<P>

Note:
A warning is always given regardless of this setting if the actual
argument is an array while the dummy argument is a scalar variable, or
if the actual argument is a scalar variable or expression while the
dummy argument is an array.  These cases are seldom intentional.
(To turn off even these warnings, use <B><A HREF="arguments.html">-arguments</A>=no-arrayness</B>.)
No warning is ever given if the actual argument is an array
element while the dummy argument is a scalar variable.
Variable-dimensioned arrays and arrays dimensioned with 1 or asterisk match any
number of array elements.
There is no check of whether multi-dimensional arrays agree in the
size of each dimension separately.
