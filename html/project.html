<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>ftnchek</B> will create a project file from each
source file that is input while this option is turned on.  The project
file will be given the same name as the input file, but with the
extension <I>.f</I> or <I>.for</I> replaced by <I>.prj</I>.
(If input is from standard input, the project file is named
<I>ftnchek.prj</I>.)

Default = none.
<P>

The <I>list</I> consists of keywords separated by commas or colons.
There are three special keywords: <B>all</B> to turn on all the
options, <B>none</B> to turn them all
off, and <B>help</B> to print the list of all the keywords with a brief
explanation of each.
If <I>list</I> is omitted, <B><A HREF="project.html">-project</A></B> is equivalent to
<B><A HREF="project.html">-project</A>=all</B>, and <B>-noproject</B> is equivalent to
<B><A HREF="project.html">-project</A>=none</B>.
The keywords with their meanings are as follows:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>create</B>:<DD>
Produce a project file.  The default is not to produce a project
file.  If this option is not turned on, the other options have no effect.
<DT><B>trim-calls</B>:<DD>
Trim the amount of information stored in the project file about
subprogram declarations and calls.  This is the default.  Turn this
option off only in rare situations.  (See discussion below.)
The amount of trimming varies depending on the <B><A HREF="library.html">-library</A></B> flag.
More information is trimmed if that flag is turned on.
<DT><B>trim-common</B>:<DD>
Trim the number of common block declarations stored in the project
file.  This is the default.  Turn this option off only in rare
situations.  (See discussion below.)
This option has no effect if the <B><A HREF="library.html">-library</A></B> flag is turned off:
when not in library mode, no trimming of common block declarations is
done regardless of this option.
</DL>
<P>

A project file contains a summary of information from the source file,
for use in checking agreement
among FUNCTION, SUBROUTINE, and COMMON
usages in other files.  It
allows incremental checking, which saves time whenever you have a
large set of files containing shared subroutines, most of which seldom
change.  You can run <B>ftnchek</B> once on each file with the
<B><A HREF="project.html">-project</A></B> flag set, creating the project files.  Usually you
would also set the <B><A HREF="library.html">-library</A></B> and <B>-noextern</B> flags at this
time, to suppress messages relating to consistency with other files.
Only error messages pertaining to each file by itself will be printed
at this time.  Thereafter, run <B>ftnchek</B> without these flags on all
the project files together, to check consistency among the different
files.  All messages internal to the individual files will now be
omitted.  Only when a file is altered will a new project file need to
be made for it.
<P>

Naturally, when the <B><A HREF="project.html">-project</A></B> option is turned on, <B>ftnchek</B> will not
read project files as input.
<P>

Ordinarily, the trim options should be left on when you intend to
create project files for future input to <B>ftnchek</B>.  Since trimming
is on by default, this means that simply giving the command
<B><A HREF="project.html">-project</A></B> with no option list is the recommended mode.  The trim
options are provided only as a convenience for those who want to make
use of project files for purposes other than checking the program with
<B>ftnchek</B>.  To use project files for their intended purpose, the
trim options should not be turned off.
<P>

Project files contain only information needed for checking
agreement between files.  This means that a project file is of no use if all
modules of the complete program are contained in a single file.
<P>

A more detailed discussion is given in the
section on Using Project Files.
