<B>ftnchek</B>
was designed by Dr. Robert Moniot, professor at Fordham
University.  During the academic year of
1988-1989, Michael Myers and Lucia Spagnuolo developed the program to
perform the variable usage checks.  During the following year it was
augmented by Lois Bigbie to check subprogram arguments and
COMMON block declarations.
Brian Downing assisted with the implementation of the INCLUDE
statement.
John Quinn wrote the common block usage checks.
Heba Elsayed wrote the label table printout and label usage checks.
Nelson H. F. Beebe of the University of Utah added most of the new code
to implement the <B><A HREF="makedcls.html">-makedcls</A></B> feature and wrote the dcl2inc script.
The <B><A HREF="mkhtml.html">-mkhtml</A></B> feature was contributed by Mark McVeigh of
Framatome ANP, Inc.
The <B><A HREF="reference.html">-reference</A></B> feature was contributed by Gerome Emmanuel,
Ecole des mines, U. Nancy (slightly modified).
The <B><A HREF="vcg.html">-vcg</A></B> option
was contributed by Dr. Philip Rubini of Cranfield University, UK.
The support for Cray pointer syntax was provided by John Dannenhoffer of
United Technologies Research Center.
John C. Bollinger of Indiana University added the parser syntax for
the SELECT CASE construct.
Additional features will be added as time permits.
As of Version 2.5, the name was changed from <B>forchek</B> to <B>ftnchek</B>,
to avoid confusion with a
similar program named <B>forcheck</B>,
developed earlier at Leiden University.
