<DD>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Prepare a neatly-formatted file of declarations of variables,
common blocks, and namelist lists, for possible
merging into the source code.  The declarations are stored in a file
of the same name as the source code, but with the extension changed to
<I>.dcl</I>.

If no declarations are written to the file, it is deleted to reduce
clutter from empty files.
<P>

If input comes from standard input, instead of a named file, then
declarations are written to standard output.
<P>

Variables are declared in alphabetical order within each declaration
class and type, with integer variables first, because of their later
possible use in array dimensions.
<P>

PARAMETER statements are an exception to the alphabetical order
rule, because the Fortran 77 Standard requires that the expressions
defining parameter values refer only to constants and already-defined
parameter names.  This forces the original source file order of such
statements to be preserved in the declaration files.
<P>

Explicit declaration of
<I>all</I>

variables is considered good modern programming practice.  By using
compiler options to reject undeclared variables, misspelled variable
names (or names extending past column 72) can be caught at compile
time.  Explicit declarations also greatly facilitate changing
floating-point precision with filters such as
<B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1L+dtoq">dtoq</A></B>(1L),

<B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1L+dtos">dtos</A></B>(1L),

<B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1L+fd2s">fd2s</A></B>(1L),

<B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1L+fs2d">fs2d</A></B>(1L),

<B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1L+qtod">qtod</A></B>(1L),

and
<B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1L+stod">stod</A></B>(1L).

These programs are capable of changing types of explicit
floating-point type declarations, intrinsic functions, and constants,
but because they do not carry out rigorous lexical and grammatical
analysis of the Fortran source code, they cannot provide modified type
declarations for undeclared variables.
Default setting = 0, turn-on = 1.
<P>

Various options for the form of the declarations file are controlled
by the <I>list</I>, which consists of keywords
separated by commas or colons.
There are three special keywords: <B>all</B> to turn on all the
options, <B>none</B> to turn them all
off, and <B>help</B> to print the list of all the keywords with a brief
explanation of each.
If <I>list</I> is omitted, <B><A HREF="makedcls.html">-makedcls</A></B> is equivalent to
<B><A HREF="makedcls.html">-makedcls</A>=declarations</B> (i.e. produce the declarations file
using the default options), and
<B>-nomakedcls</B> is equivalent to <B><A HREF="makedcls.html">-makedcls</A>=none</B>.
<P>

For compatibility with previous versions of <B>ftnchek</B>, a numeric
form of this setting is also accepted:  the <I>list</I> is replaced by
a number which is the sum of the numbers in parentheses beside
the keywords in the following list.
The warning keywords with their meanings are as follows:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>declarations</B> (1):<DD>
Write a declaration file.  (This is implied by any of the other
options, and can be omitted if any other options are given.)
<DT><B>undeclared-only</B> (2):<DD>
By default, all variables are included in the declaration file.  With
this option, include only
<I>undeclared</I>

variables.  This setting is useful if you want to check for undeclared
variables, since Fortran source files with all variables properly
declared will not result in a
<I>.dcl</I>

file.
With this option, common blocks and namelist lists will not be
included in the declaration file, since by their nature they cannot be
undeclared.
<DT><B>compact</B> (4):<DD>
The declarations are normally prettyprinted to line up neatly in
common columns, as in the declaration files output by the Extended
PFORT Verifier,
<B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1L+pfort">pfort</A></B>(1L).

This option value selects instead compact output, without column
alignment.
<DT><B>use-continuation-lines</B> (8):<DD>
Causes continuation lines to be used where permissible.
The default is to begin a new declaration on each line.  This option
is appropriate to use together with <B>compact</B>.
<DT><B>keywords-lowercase</B> (16):<DD>
Output Fortran keywords in lowercase, instead of the default
uppercase.
<DT><B>vars-and-consts-lowercase</B> (32):<DD>
Output variables and constants in lowercase, instead of the default
uppercase.   Character string constants are not affected by this
option.
<DT><B>exclude-sftran3</B> (64):<DD>
Omit declarations of internal integer variables produced by the
SFTRAN3 preprocessor,
<B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1L+xsf3">xsf3</A></B>(1L),

as part of the translation of structured Fortran statements to
ordinary Fortran.  These variables have six-character names of the
form
<I>NPRddd</I>,

<I>NXdddd</I>,

<I>N2dddd</I>,

and
<I>N3dddd</I>,

where
<I>d</I>

is a decimal digit.  Because they are invisible in the SFTRAN3 source
code, and will change if the SFTRAN3 code is modified, such variables
should not be explicitly declared.  Instead, they should just assume
the default Fortran INTEGER data type based on their initial letter,
<I>N</I>.

<DT><B>asterisk-comment</B> (128):<DD>
Use an asterisk as the comment character; the default is otherwise 'C'.
<DT><B>comment-char-lowercase</B> (256):<DD>
Use 'c' instead of 'C' or '*' as the comment character.
<DT><B>suppress-array-dimensions</B> (512):<DD>
Suppress dimensioning of arrays in the generated declarations.
This option is for use with code lacking type declarations, to allow
the declaration files to be inserted without change into the code.  Since
the code will have dimension statements already, dimensioning the
array variables in the type statements of the declaration file is redundant.
This option should be used only in conjunction with
option 2 = undeclared-only because otherwise any arrays that were
dimensioned in a type statement will lose their dimensioning.
<DT><B>free-form</B> (1024):<DD>
Produce declarations in free source form.  This mode is automatically
used if the input source is free form.  Use this option to produce
declarations in free form even if the input is in fixed form.  Free
form declarations are indented only 2 columns instead of 6, use the
exclamation mark as the comment character, and indicate continuation
lines by an ampersand at the end of the line to be continued.
</DL>
<P>

The declaration files contain distinctive comments that mark the start
and end of declarations for each program unit, to facilitate using
text editor macros for merging the declarations back into the source
code.
<P>

The <B>ftnchek</B> distribution includes a program, <B>dcl2inc</B>,
which processes declaration files to produce files containing
declarations of all COMMON blocks, in a form suitable for use as
INCLUDE files.  See the
<B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1L+dcl2inc">dcl2inc</A></B>(1L)

man page for the details
of its use.
