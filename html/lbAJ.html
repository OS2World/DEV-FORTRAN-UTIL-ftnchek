<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A> <H2>INTERPRETING THE OUTPUT</H2>

The messages given by
<B>ftnchek</B> include not only
syntax errors but also warnings and informational messages
about things that are legal Fortran but that may indicate errors or
carelessness.
Most of these messages can be turned off by
command-line options.  Which option controls each message
depends on
the nature of the condition being warned about.  See the
descriptions of the command-line flags in the previous sections,
and of individual messages below.
Each message is prefixed with a word or phrase indicating the nature
of the condition and its severity.
<P>

``Error'' means a syntax error.  The simplest
kind of syntax errors are typographical errors, for example unbalanced
parentheses or misspelling of a keyword.  This type of error is caught
by the parser and appears with the description ``parse error'' or
``syntax error'' (depending on whether the parser was built using GNU
<B>bison</B> or UNIX <B>yacc</B> respectively).
This type of error message cannot be
suppressed.  Be aware that this type of error often means
that <B>ftnchek</B> has not properly interpreted the statement where the
error occurs, so that its subsequent checking operations will be
compromised.  You should eliminate all syntax errors before proceeding to
interpret the other messages <B>ftnchek</B> gives.
<P>

``Warning: Nonstandard syntax'' indicates an extension to Fortran that
<B>ftnchek</B> supports but that is not according to the Fortran 77 Standard.
The extensions that <B>ftnchek</B> accepts
are described in the section on Extensions below.
One example is the DO ... ENDDO construction.
If a program uses these extensions, warnings will be
given according to specifications under the <B><A HREF="f77.html">-f77</A></B> setting.
The default behavior is to give no warnings.
<P>

``Warning'' in other cases
means a condition that is suspicious but that may or may not
be a programming error.  Frequently these conditions are legal under
the standard.  Some are illegal but do not fall under the heading
of syntax errors.
Usage errors are one example.
These refer to the possibility that a variable may be used before
it has been assigned a value (generally an error),
or that a variable is declared but never used (harmless but may
indicate carelessness).
The amount of checking for usage errors is controlled by
the <B><A HREF="usage.html">-usage</A></B> flag, which specifies
the maximum amount of checking by default.
<P>

Truncation warnings cover situations in which accuracy may be lost
unintentionally, for example when a double precision value is assigned
to a real variable.  These warnings are controlled by the
<B><A HREF="truncation.html">-truncation</A></B> setting, which is on by default.
<P>

``Nonportable usage'' warns about some feature that may not be
accepted by some compilers even though it is not contrary
to the Fortran 77 Standard, or that may cause the program to perform
differently on different platforms.
For example, equivalencing real
and integer variables is usually a non-portable practice.
The use of extensions to the standard language is, of course, another
source of non-portability, but this is handled as a separate case.  To
check a program for true portability, both the <B><A HREF="portability.html">-portability</A></B> and
the <B><A HREF="f77.html">-f77</A></B> flags should be used.  They are both turned off by
default.  The <B><A HREF="wordsize.html">-wordsize</A></B> setting is provided to check only those
nonportable usages that depend on a particular machine wordsize.
<P>

``Possibly misleading appearance'' is used for legal constructions that may not
mean what they appear to mean at first glance.  For example, Fortran is
insensitive to blank space, so extraneous space within variable names
or the lack of space between a keyword and a variable can convey the wrong
impression to the reader.
These messages can be suppressed by turning off the <B><A HREF="pretty.html">-pretty</A></B>
flag, which is on by default.
<P>

Other messages that are given after all the files are processed,
and having to do with agreement between modules, do not use the word
``warning'' but generally fall into that category.
Examples include type mismatches between corresponding variables in
different COMMON
block declarations, or between dummy and actual arguments of a
subprogram.
These warnings are controlled by the <B><A HREF="common.html">-common</A></B> and
<B><A HREF="arguments.html">-arguments</A></B> settings respectively.  By default both are set for
maximum strictness of checking.
<P>

Another group of warnings about conditions that are often harmless
refer to cases where the array properties of a variable
passed as a subprogram argument differ between the two routines.
For instance, an array element might be passed to a subroutine that
expects a whole array.  This is a commonly-used technique for
processing single rows or columns of two-dimensional arrays.
However, it could also indicate a programming error.  The
<B><A HREF="array.html">-array</A></B> setting allows the user to adjust the degree of
strictness to be used in checking this kind of agreement between
actual and dummy array arguments.  By default
the strictness is maximum.
<P>

``Oops'' indicates a technical
problem, meaning either a bug in <B>ftnchek</B> or that its resources have
been exceeded.
<P>

The syntax error messages and warnings include
the filename along with the line number and column
number.  <B>ftnchek</B> has two different options for the
appearance of these error messages.  If <B><A HREF="novice.html">-novice</A></B> is in effect,
which is the default,
the messages are in a style approximating
normal English.  (In default style, the filename is
not printed in messages within the body of the program if <B><A HREF="list.html">-list</A></B> is in
effect.)  The other style of error messages is selected by the
<B>-nonovice</B> option.  In this
style, the appearance of the messages is similar to that of the
UNIX <B>lint</B> program.
<P>

<B>ftnchek</B> is still blind to some kinds of syntax errors.
The two most important ones are detailed checking of FORMAT statements,
and almost anything to do with control of execution
flow by means of IF, DO,
and GOTO statements: namely correct nesting of control structures,
matching of opening statements such as IF ... THEN with
closing statements such as ENDIF, and the proper use of
statement labels (numbers).  Most compilers will catch these errors.
See the section on Limitations for a more detailed discussion.
<P>

If <B>ftnchek</B> gives you a syntax error message when the compiler does
not, it may be because your program contains an extension to
standard Fortran which is accepted by the compiler but not by
<B>ftnchek</B>.  (See the section on Extensions.)
On a VAX/VMS system, you can use the compiler option /STANDARD
to cause the compiler to accept only standard Fortran.
On most UNIX or UNIX-like systems, this can be accomplished by
setting the flag <B>-ansi.</B>
<P>

Many of the messages given by <B>ftnchek</B> are self-explanatory.
Those that need some additional explanation are listed below in
alphabetical order.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>Common block NAME: data type mismatch at position n</I>

<DD>
The <I>n</I>-th variable in the COMMON block differs in data type
in two different declarations of the COMMON block.  By default
(<B><A HREF="common.html">-common</A></B> strictness level 3), <B>ftnchek</B> is very picky about
COMMON blocks: the variables listed in them must match exactly
by data type and array dimensions.  That is, the legal pair of
declarations in different modules:
<PRE>
     COMMON /COM1/ A,B
and
     COMMON /COM1/ <A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+A">A</A>(2)
</PRE>

<BR>

will cause <B>ftnchek</B> to give warnings at strictness level 3.  These
two declarations are legal in Fortran since they both declare two real
variables.  At strictness level 1 or 2, no warning would be given in
this example, but the warning would
be given if there were a data type mismatch, for instance, if B
were declared INTEGER.
Controlled by <B><A HREF="common.html">-common</A></B> setting.
<P>
<DT><I>Common block NAME has long data type following short data type</I>

<DD>
Some compilers require alignment of multi-byte items so that each item
begins at an address that is a multiple of the item size.  Thus if a
short (e.g. single-precision real) item is followed by a long (e.g.
double precision real) item, the latter may not be aligned correctly.
Controlled by <B><A HREF="portability.html">-portability</A>=common-alignment</B> option.
<P>
<DT><I>Common block NAME has mixed character and non-character variables</I>

<DD>
The ANSI standard requires that if any variable in a COMMON
block is of type CHARACTER, then all other variables in the
same COMMON block must also be of type CHARACTER.
Controlled by <B><A HREF="f77.html">-f77</A>=mixed-common</B> option.
<P>
<DT><I>Common block NAME: varying length</I>

<DD>
For <B><A HREF="common.html">-common</A></B> setting level 2, this message means that
a COMMON block is declared to have different numbers of words in two
different subprograms.  A word is the amount of storage occupied by
one integer or real variable.
For <B><A HREF="common.html">-common</A></B> setting level 3, it means that the two declarations
have different numbers of variables, where an array of any size is
considered one variable.
This is not
necessarily an error, but it may indicate that a variable is missing
from one of the lists.  Note that according to the Fortran 77 Standard,
it is an error for named COMMON blocks (but not blank COMMON) to differ
in number of words in declarations in different modules.
Given for <B><A HREF="common.html">-common</A></B> setting 2 or 3.
<P>
<DT><I>Error: Badly formed logical/relational operator or constant</I>

<DD>
<DT><I>Error: Badly formed real constant</I>

<DD>
The syntax analyzer has found the start of
one of the special words that begin and
end with a period (e.g. .EQ.), or the start of a numeric constant,
but did not succeed in finding a complete item of that kind.
<P>
<DT><I>Error: cannot be adjustable size in module NAME</I>

<DD>
A character variable cannot be declared with a size that is an
asterisk in parentheses unless it is a dummy argument, a parameter, or
the name of the function defined in the module.
<P>
<DT><I>Error: cannot be declared in SAVE statement in module NAME</I>

<DD>
Only local variables and common blocks can be declared in a
SAVE statement.
<P>
<DT><I>Error: No path to this statement</I>

<DD>
<B>ftnchek</B> will detect statements which are ignored or by-passed because
there is no foreseeable route to the statement.  For example, an
unnumbered statement (a statement without a statement label), occurring
immediately after a GOTO
statement, cannot possibly be executed.
<P>
<DT><I>Error: Parse error</I>

<DD>
This means that the parser, which analyzes the Fortran
program into expressions,
statements, etc., has been unable to find a valid interpretation for some
portion of a statement in the program.  If your compiler does not report a
syntax error at the same place, the most common explanations are: (1) use of an
extension to ANSI standard Fortran that is not recognized by
<B>ftnchek</B>, or (2) the statement requires more lookahead than
<B>ftnchek</B> uses (see section on Bugs).
<DT><DD>
NOTE: This message means that the affected statement is not interpreted.
Therefore, it is possible that <B>ftnchek</B>'s
subsequent processing will be in error, if it depends on any matters
affected by this statement (type declarations, etc.).
<P>
<DT><I>Error: Syntax error</I>

<DD>
This is the same as ``Error: Parse error'' (see above).  It is generated
if your version of <B>ftnchek</B> was built using the UNIX <B>yacc</B>
parser generator rather than GNU <B>bison</B>.
<P>
<DT><I>Identifiers which are not unique in first six chars</I>

<DD>
Warns that two identifiers which are longer than 6 characters do not
differ in the first 6 characters.  This is for portability: they may not
be considered distinct by some compilers.
Controlled by <B><A HREF="sixchar.html">-sixchar</A></B> option.
<P>
<DT><I>Nonportable usage: argument precision may not be correct for intrinsic function</I>

<DD>
The precision of an argument passed to an intrinsic function may be
incorrect on some computers.  Issued when a numeric variable declared
with explicit precision (e.g.  REAL*8 X) is passed to a
specific intrinsic function (e.g. DSQRT(X)).
Controlled by <B><A HREF="portability.html">-portability</A>=mixed-size</B> and <B><A HREF="wordsize.html">-wordsize</A></B>.
<P>
<DT><I>Nonportable usage: character constant/variable length exceeds 255</I>

<DD>
Some compilers do not support character strings more than 255
characters in length.
Controlled by <B><A HREF="portability.html">-portability</A>=long-string</B>.
<P>
<DT><I>Nonportable usage: File contains tabs</I>

<DD>
<B>ftnchek</B> expands tabs to be equivalent to spaces up to the next column
which is a multiple of 8.  Some compilers treat tabs differently, and
also it is possible that files sent by electronic mail will have the tabs
converted to blanks in some way.  Therefore files containing tabs may not
be compiled correctly after being transferred.  <B>ftnchek</B> does not give
this message if tabs only occur within comments or character constants.
Controlled by <B><A HREF="portability.html">-portability</A>=tab</B>.
<P>
<DT><I>Nonportable usage: non-integer DO loop bounds</I>

<DD>
This warning is only given when the DO index and bounds are
non-integer.
Use of non-integer quantities in a DO statement may cause
unexpected errors, or different results on different machines, due to
roundoff effects.
Controlled by <B><A HREF="portability.html">-portability</A>=real-do</B>.
<P>
<DT><I>Possibly it is an array which was not declared</I>

<DD>
This message is appended to warnings related to
a function invocation or to an argument type
mismatch, for which the possibility exists that what appears to be a
function is actually meant to be an array.  If the programmer forgot to
dimension an array, references to the array will be interpreted as
function invocations.  This message will be suppressed if the name in
question appears in an EXTERNAL or INTRINSIC statement.
Controlled by the <B><A HREF="novice.html">-novice</A></B> option.
<P>
<DT><I>Possibly misleading appearance: characters past 72 columns</I>

<DD>
The program is being processed with the statement field width at its
standard value of 72, and some nonblank characters have been found
past column 72.  In this case,
<B>ftnchek</B> is not processing the characters past column 72, and is
notifying the user that the statement may not have the meaning that it
appears to have.  These characters might be intended by the programmer to be
significant, but they will be ignored by the compiler.  Controlled by
<B><A HREF="pretty.html">-pretty</A>=long-line</B>.
<P>
<DT><I>Possibly misleading appearance: Common block declared in more than one statement</I>

<DD>
Such multiple declarations are legal and have the same effect as
a continuation of the original declaration of the block.
This warning is only given if the two declarations are separated by
one or more intervening statements.
Controlled by <B><A HREF="pretty.html">-pretty</A>=multiple-common</B>.
<P>
<DT><I>Possibly misleading appearance: Continuation follows comment or blank line</I>

<DD>
<B>ftnchek</B> issues this warning message to alert the user that a
continuation of a statement is interspersed with comments, making it easy
to overlook.
Controlled by <B><A HREF="pretty.html">-pretty</A>=continuation</B>.
<P>
<DT><I>Possibly misleading appearance: Extraneous parentheses</I>

<DD>
Warns about parentheses surrounding a variable by itself in an
expression.  When a parenthesized variable is passed as an argument to
a subprogram, it is treated as an expression, not as a variable whose
value can be modified by the called routine.
Controlled by <B><A HREF="pretty.html">-pretty</A>=parentheses</B>.
<P>
<DT><I>Subprogram NAME: argument data type mismatch at position n</I>

<DD>
The subprogram's
<I>n</I>-th actual argument (in the CALL or the
usage of a function) differs in datatype or precision from the <I>n</I>-th dummy
argument (in the SUBROUTINE or FUNCTION
declaration).  For instance, if the user defines a
subprogram by
<PRE>
     SUBROUTINE SUBA(X)
     REAL X
</PRE>

and elsewhere invokes SUBA by
<PRE>
     CALL <A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+SUBA">SUBA</A>(2)
</PRE>

<BR>

<B>ftnchek</B> will detect the error.  The reason here
is that the number 2 is integer, not real.  The user should have written
<PRE>
     CALL SUBA(2.0)
</PRE>

<DT><DD>
When checking an argument which is a subprogram, <B>ftnchek</B> must be
able to determine whether it is a function or a subroutine.  The rules
used by <B>ftnchek</B> to do this are as follows: If the subprogram,
besides being passed as an actual argument, is also invoked directly
elsewhere in the same module, then its type is determined by that
usage.  If not, then if the name of the subprogram does not appear in
an explicit type declaration, it is assumed to be a subroutine; if it
is explicitly typed it is taken as a function.  Therefore, subroutines
passed as actual arguments need only be declared by an EXTERNAL
statement in the calling module, whereas functions must also be
explicitly typed in order to avoid generating this error message.
Controlled by <B><A HREF="arguments.html">-arguments</A></B> setting.
<P>
<DT><I>Subprogram NAME: argument arrayness mismatch at position n</I>

<DD>
Similar to the preceding situation, but
the subprogram dummy argument differs from the corresponding actual
argument in its number of dimensions or number of elements.
Controlled by <B><A HREF="array.html">-array</A></B> together with <B><A HREF="arguments.html">-arguments</A></B> settings.
<P>
<DT><I>Subprogram NAME: argument mismatch at position n</I>

<DD>
A character dummy argument is larger than the corresponding actual
argument, or a Hollerith dummy argument is larger than the
corresponding actual argument.  Controlled by <B><A HREF="arguments.html">-arguments</A></B> setting.
<P>
<DT><I>Subprogram NAME: argument usage mismatch</I>

<DD>
<B>ftnchek</B> detects a possible conflict between the way a subprogram uses
an argument and the way in which the argument is supplied to the
subprogram.  The conflict can be one of two types, as outlined below.
<P>
<DT><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<DD>

<I>Dummy arg is modified, Actual arg is const or expr</I>

A dummy argument is an argument as named in a SUBROUTINE or
FUNCTION statement and used within the subprogram.  An actual
argument is an argument as passed to a subroutine or function by the
caller.  <B>ftnchek</B> is saying that a dummy argument is modified by
the subprogram, implying that its value is changed in the calling module.
The corresponding actual argument should not be a constant or
expression, but rather a variable or array element which can be
legitimately assigned to.
Controlled by the <B><A HREF="usage.html">-usage</A>=arg-const-modified</B> option.
<P>
<DT><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<DD>

<I>Dummy arg used before set, Actual arg not set</I>

Here a dummy argument may be used in the subprogram
before having a value assigned to it by the subprogram.  The
corresponding actual argument should have a value assigned to it by the
caller prior to invoking the subprogram.
Controlled by the <B><A HREF="usage.html">-usage</A>=var-uninitialized</B> option.
<DT><DD>
This warning is not affected by the <B><A HREF="arguments.html">-arguments</A></B> setting.
<P>
<DT><I>Subprogram NAME invoked inconsistently</I>

<DD>
Here the mismatch is between the datatype of the subprogram itself as
used and as defined. For instance, if the user declares
<PRE>
     INTEGER FUNCTION COUNT(A)
</PRE>

and invokes COUNT in another module as
<PRE>
     N = COUNT(A)
</PRE>

<BR>

without declaring its datatype, it will default to real type, based on
the first letter of its name.  The calling module should have included
the declaration
<PRE>
     INTEGER COUNT
</PRE>

<DT><DD>
Given for <B><A HREF="arguments.html">-arguments</A></B> setting 2 or 3.
<P>
<DT><I>Subprogram NAME:  varying length argument lists:</I>

<DD>
An inconsistency has been found between the number of dummy arguments
(parameters) a subprogram has and the number of actual arguments given it
in an invocation.
<B>ftnchek</B> keeps track of all invocations of subprograms
(CALL
statements and expressions using functions) and compares them with
the definitions of the subprograms elsewhere in the source code.  The
Fortran compiler normally does not catch this type of error.
Given for <B><A HREF="arguments.html">-arguments</A></B> setting 1 or 3.
<P>
<DT><I>Variable not declared.  Type has been implicitly defined</I>

<DD>
When printing the symbol table for a module,
<B>ftnchek</B> will flag with an asterisk
all identifiers that are not explicitly typed
and will show the datatype that was assigned through implicit typing.
This provides support for users who wish to declare all variables as
is required in Pascal or some other languages.
This message appears only when the <B><A HREF="symtab.html">-symtab</A></B> option is in effect.
Alternatively, use the <B><A HREF="declare.html">-declare</A></B> flag if you want to get a list of all
undeclared variables.
<P>

<DD>
The way that functions in Fortran return a value is by assigning the

portable.  The function will be treated by <B>ftnchek</B> as a
user-defined function.  This warning is not suppressed by any
option, since it affects <B>ftnchek</B>'s analysis of
the program.  However, if the intrinsic function is in one of the
supported sets of nonstandard intrinsics, you can use the
<B><A HREF="intrinsic.html">-intrinsic</A></B> setting to cause <B>ftnchek</B> to recognize it.
