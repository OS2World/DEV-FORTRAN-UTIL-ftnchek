Selects a shorter format for some warning messages.  At present, the
only warnings controlled by this flag are those that are printed at
the end of processing each subprogram.  These include warnings about
variables that are set but not used or used before set, variable names
that do not conform to the Fortran 77 standard, etc.  (These warnings
may be suppressed entirely depending on other flags, such as the
<B><A HREF="usage.html">-usage</A></B> or <B><A HREF="f77.html">-f77</A></B> flags.)  In the default format each
variable is listed on a separate line, along with the line number
where the variable is declared, set or used, according to the nature
of the warning.  The briefer format simply lists all variables to
which the warning applies, with up to 4 variables per line.
