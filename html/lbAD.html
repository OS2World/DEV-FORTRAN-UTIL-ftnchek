<B>ftnchek</B> (short for Fortran checker)
is designed to detect certain errors in a
Fortran program that a compiler usually does not.
<B>ftnchek</B> is not primarily
intended to detect syntax errors.  Its purpose is to assist the user in finding
semantic errors.  Semantic errors are legal in the Fortran language but are
wasteful or may cause incorrect operation.  For example, variables which are
never used may indicate some omission in the program; uninitialized variables
contain garbage which may cause incorrect results to be calculated; and
variables which are not declared may not have the intended type.
<B>ftnchek</B> is
intended to assist users in the debugging of their Fortran program.  It is not
intended to catch all syntax errors.  This is the function of the compiler.
Prior to using <B>ftnchek</B>,
the user should verify that the program compiles
correctly.

<P>

This document first summarizes how to invoke <B>ftnchek</B>.
That section should be read before beginning to use <B>ftnchek</B>.
Later sections describe <B>ftnchek</B>'s
options in more detail, give an example of its use, and explain
how to interpret the output.  The final sections mention the limitations
and known bugs in
<B>ftnchek</B>.
