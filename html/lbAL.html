<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A> <H2>NEW FEATURES</H2>

Here are the changes from Version 3.1 to Version 3.2:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.<DD>
New option <B><A HREF="mkhtml.html">-mkhtml</A></B> to generate HTML documentation files from
the source code.  Thanks go to Mark McVeigh for contributing this feature.
<DT>2.<DD>
I/O unit usage information is now provided under the <B><A HREF="symtab.html">-symtab</A></B>
option.  A table is printed listing each I/O unit by name and/or
number, together with the operations performed on it.
<DT>3.<DD>
A single large project file, created by
concatenating a number of separately produced
project files, can be input for use as a library project file.
<DT>4.<DD>
Combined type declarations and data-statement-like initializers, as
in INTEGER  N / 100 / are accepted. 
<DT>5.<DD>
Fixed a bug that caused <B>ftnchek</B> to crash if a parameter is declared
with the same name as the subprogram containing it.  New error message
for same.
<DT>6.<DD>
Fixed a bug in checking type agreement between variables and their
initial values in Fortran 90<A HREF="style.html">-style</A> declarations with initializers, as
in INTEGER :: N=100.
<DT>7.<DD>
New error message when an internal file is a constant rather than a
variable.  Some compilers permit this for READ operations, but
it is prohibited by the F90 Standard in section 9.2.2.1.
</DL>
<P>

Here are the changes from Version 3.0 to Version 3.1:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.<DD>
New checks for proper nesting of block structures such as IF ...
END IF.
<DT>2.<DD>
Limited support for attribute-based type declarations.  Read the
section on Extensions for details.  Note that this new feature should
be seen as a first step toward full support for Fortran 90 type
declarations, but it is not there yet.  The level of support may be
sufficient for novice programmers, but it is not yet ready for serious
use.
<DT>3.<DD>
New flag <B><A HREF="style.html">-style</A></B> for users who want to adhere to a strict
modern programming style.  This flag controls warnings about legal
Fortran 77 constructs such as GOTO that are more error-prone
than the newer constructs available in Fortran 90.
<DT>4.<DD>
The <B><A HREF="source.html">-source</A></B> options <B>parameter-implicit-type</B> and
<B>dec-parameter-standard-type</B> were changed to
<B>param-implicit-type</B> and <B>dec-param-standard-type</B>
respectively for consistency with other options also related to
parameters, which all use <B>param-</B>.
<DT>5.<DD>
New warnings: modification of a DO variable inside its loop (controlled by
<B><A HREF="usage.html">-usage</A>=do-index-modified</B> option), and alternate return using
a constant value that does not correspond to a label argument
(controlled by a new <B><A HREF="pretty.html">-pretty</A>=alternate-return</B> option).
<DT>6.<DD>
Fixed a bug that caused project files to contain incorrect information
about actual arguments that are parameters.  This bug had no effect on
checking of programs using the project files, since the bogus information
was not used in these cases.
<DT>7.<DD>
The <B><A HREF="project.html">-project</A></B> flag now takes options to control how much
information about subprogram calls and common blocks should be
stored.  These options are mainly of interest to those who want to use
project files for purposes other than checking the program with
<B>ftnchek</B>.
<DT>8.<DD>
Changed the way that the HTML documentation is produced.  The main
change is that URLs referring to man pages have a different form.
Also got rid of the symbolic links in the html directory, which cause
problems on systems that do not support such links.
<DT>9.<DD>
Implementation changes for faster execution.  The speedup is about a
factor of two in some cases.
