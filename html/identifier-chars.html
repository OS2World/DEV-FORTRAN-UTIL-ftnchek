Define non-alphanumeric characters that may be used in identifiers.
By default, <B>ftnchek</B> only accepts the dollar sign and underscore
as non-alphanumeric characters in identifier names.  The characters in
the <I>list</I> replace whatever set of accepted non-alphanumeric characters
was previously in effect.  Thus, if dollar sign or underscore are not
included in the list, they lose their status as acceptable characters.
<P>

This option is provided to enable <B>ftnchek</B> to handle source files
containing non-standard identifer names that may be needed, for
example, to access certain operating system services.  See the section
on Limitations and Extensions for the treatment of identifiers
containing these characters in implicit typing.
<P>

Using <B>-noidentifer-chars</B> turns off acceptance of
non-alphanumeric characters entirely.
