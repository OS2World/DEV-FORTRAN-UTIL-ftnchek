Assume functions are ``pure'', i.e., they will not have
side effects by modifying their arguments or variables in a COMMON
block.  When this flag is in effect, <B>ftnchek</B> will base its
determination of set and used status of the actual arguments on the
assumption that arguments passed to a function are not altered.  It
will also issue a warning if a function is found to modify any of its
arguments or any COMMON variables.
Default = yes.
<P>

When this flag is turned off, actual arguments passed to functions
will be handled the same way as actual arguments passed to
subroutines.  This means that <B>ftnchek</B> will assume that arguments
may be modified by the functions.  No warnings will be given if a
function is found to have side effects.  Because stricter checking is
possible if functions are assumed to be pure, you should turn this flag
off only if your program actually uses functions with side effects.
