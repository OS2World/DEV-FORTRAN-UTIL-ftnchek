This section contains detailed information on how to use project files
most effectively, and how to avoid some pitfalls.
<P>

One can divide the checks
<B>ftnchek</B> does into two categories, local and global.  Local
checking is restricted to within a single routine,
and catches things like uninitialized variables, unintended loss
of precision in arithmetic expressions, etc.  This sort of checking
can be done on each subprogram independently.  Furthermore,
local checking of a subprogram does not need to be repeated when some other
subprogram is changed.  Global checking catches things like calling a
subroutine with the wrong argument types, or disagreeing in common
block declarations.  It requires looking at the whole set of subprograms
interacting with each other.
<P>

The purpose of project files is to allow the local checking and global
checking steps to be separated.  Assuming that each subprogram is in
its own source file, you can run <B>ftnchek</B> once on each one to do local
checking while suppressing global checking.
Then <B>ftnchek</B> can be run once on all the project
files together to do the global checking.  The sample makefile below
shows how to automate this task.  The ``.f.prj'' target updates a
project file for a particular file any time the source file changes.
The information needed for global checking is saved
in the project file.
The ``check'' target does the combined global checking.
Typically ``make check'' would repeat the ``ftnchek
-project'' step only on changed source
files, then do the global check.  This is obviously a big advantage
for large programs, when many subprograms seldom if ever change.
<P>

It is best when using project files to place each subprogram
in a separate source file.  If each source file may contain more than one
subprogram,  it complicates the definition of ``local'' and ``global''
checking because there is some inter-module checking that is contained
within a file.  <B>ftnchek</B> tries to do the right thing in this
case, but there are some complications (described below) due to the
trade-off between avoiding re-doing cross-checks and preserving
information about the program's structure.
<P>

Ordinarily, to do the least amount of re-checking, project files should be
created with the <B><A HREF="library.html">-library</A></B>
flag in effect and trimming turned on.  In this mode,
the information saved in the project file consists of all subprogram
declarations, all subprogram invocations not resolved by declarations in the
same file, and one instance of each COMMON
block declaration.  This is the minimum amount of information needed
to check agreement between files.
<P>

If the source file contains more than one routine, there are some
possible problems that can arise from creating the project file in
library mode, because the calling
hierarchy among routines defined within the file is lost.  Also,
if the routines in the file make use of COMMON
blocks that are shared with routines in other files, there will not be
enough information saved for the correct checking of set and used
status of COMMON blocks and COMMON variables according to the
<B><A HREF="usage.html">-usage</A></B> setting.  Therefore if
you plan to use project files when <B><A HREF="usage.html">-usage</A></B>
checking is turned on (which is the default situation), and if
multiple routines in one
project file share COMMON blocks with routines in other files,
the project files
should be created with the <B><A HREF="library.html">-library</A></B> flag turned off.
In this mode, <B>ftnchek</B> saves, besides
the information listed above, one invocation of each subprogram by
any other subprogram in the same file, and all COMMON block
declarations.  This means that the project file will be larger than
necessary, and that when it is read in, <B>ftnchek</B> may repeat some
inter-module checks that it already did when the project file was
created.  If each project file contains only one
module, there is no loss of information in creating the project
files in library mode.
<P>

Because of the possible loss of information entailed by creating a project file
with the <B><A HREF="library.html">-library</A></B> flag in effect, whenever that project file is read
in later, it will be treated as a library file regardless of the
current setting of the <B><A HREF="library.html">-library</A></B> flag.  On the other hand, a project
file created with library mode turned off can be read in later in either
mode.
<P>

The foregoing discussion assumes that the trimming options of the
<B><A HREF="project.html">-project</A></B> setting are turned on when the project file is
created.  This is the normal situation.  The <B>no-trim</B> options of
the <B><A HREF="project.html">-project</A></B> setting are provided in case one wants to use the
project files for purposes other than checking the program with
<B>ftnchek</B>.  For instance, one could write a Perl script to analyze
the project files for information about how the different subprograms
are called.  You should not use the <B>no-trim</B> options to deal
with the issues of information loss discussed above, since they cause
more information than necessary to be stored.  This makes the project
files bigger and causes <B>ftnchek</B> to do more work later when it reads
them to check your complete program.  Ordinarily, you should use the
<B><A HREF="library.html">-library</A></B> option to control how much information to store for
later use by <B>ftnchek</B> in checking your program.
<P>

Here is an example of how to use the UNIX <B>make</B> utility to
automatically create a new project file each time the corresponding
source file is altered, and to check the set of files for consistency.
Add these lines to your makefile.
The example assumes that a macro OBJS has been defined which
lists all the names of object files to be linked together to form the
complete executable program.
(In this makefile, the indented lines should each begin with a
tab, not blanks.)
If any source file contains multiple routines that share
common blocks among themselves, then the no-com-\* option
should be removed from NOGLOBAL, and/or drop the <A HREF="library.html">-library</A> flag.
<PRE>

    # tell make what a project file suffix is
    .SUFFIXES: .prj

    # these options suppress global checks.
    NOGLOBAL=<A HREF="usage.html">-usage</A>=no-ext-undefined,no-com-\*

    # tell make how to create a .prj file from a .f file
    .f.prj:
            ftnchek <A HREF="project.html">-project</A> $(NOGLOBAL) <A HREF="library.html">-library</A> $&lt;

    # set up macro PRJS containing project filenames
    PRJS= $(OBJS:.o=.prj)

    # &quot;make check&quot; will check everything that has been changed.
    check: $(PRJS)
            ftnchek $(PRJS)

</PRE>

<P>

When a program uses many routines defined in a large number of
different source files in different directories, it can be
cumbersome to specify all the different project files needed to check
the program properly.  To deal with such cases, <B>ftnchek</B> allows
project files to be concatenated into a single large file.  This
single file can then be given to <B>ftnchek</B> to provide the
information for checking the use of any or all of the routines defined
in the combined project files.  When using such a ``library''
project file, you may want <B>ftnchek</B>'s error reports to document
precisely the name of the file where the specific function is defined.
If the various source files are in several directories,
an error report that gives only the file name may be ambiguous, and rather
should include the path to the file.  The solution is to create
each of the individual project files by giving the complete path to
the source file.  Then this complete path will appear in the error
reports.  For example, suppose that all of the library subprogram
source files are in subdirectories of a directory named
/util/lib.  Then the individual project files
could first be created by a command such as
<PRE>

find /util/lib -name '*.f' -exec ftnchek <A HREF="project.html">-project</A> '{}' ';'

</PRE>

(Possibly other options would be provided to <B>ftnchek</B> as
discussed above.  Also, this step could be handled instead by a
revised makefile rule that would provide the complete
source file path instead of just the local name when invoking
<B>ftnchek</B>.)  Next, concatenate all of these project files manually.
<PRE>

find /util/lib -name '*.prj' -exec cat '{}' ';' &gt; ourlib.prj

</PRE>

Then a program source file can be checked by using the command
<PRE>

ftnchek prog.f ... -lib ourlib.prj

</PRE>

and an error message related to any library routine will include
the full path to the routine's source file.
<P>

At present, there is no archive utility like <B>ar</B> to manage the
contents of a concatenated project file like the one in the
illustration above.  If changes are made to one of the library
routines, the only way to update the combined project file is to
concatenate all the individual project files once again.  Such a
utility would be quite easy to write.  Someone should do so and
contribute it to the <B>ftnchek</B> effort.
