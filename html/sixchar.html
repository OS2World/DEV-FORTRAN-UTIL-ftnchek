One of the goals of the <B>ftnchek</B> program is to
help users to write portable Fortran programs.  One potential source
of nonportability is the use of variable names that are longer than
six characters.  Some compilers just ignore the extra characters.
This behavior could potentially lead to two different variables being
considered as the same.  For instance, variables named AVERAGECOST
and AVERAGEPRICE are the same in the first six characters.  If
you wish to catch such possible conflicts, use this flag.  Default =
no.
<P>

Use the <B><A HREF="f77.html">-f77</A>=long-names</B> if you want to
list <I>all</I>
variables longer than six characters, not just those pairs that are the same in
the first six.
