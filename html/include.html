Specifies a directory to be searched for files
specified by INCLUDE statements.  Unlike other command-line
options, this setting is cumulative; that is, if it is given more than
once on the command line, all the directories so specified are placed
on a list that will be searched in the same order as they are given.
The order in which <B>ftnchek</B> searches for a file to be included is:
the current directory; the directory specified by
environment
variable FTNCHEK_INCLUDE if any;
the directories specified by any <B><A HREF="include.html">-include</A></B> options;
the directory specified by environment variable INCLUDE;
and finally in
a standard system-wide directory
(/usr/include for UNIX, SYS$LIBRARY for VMS,
and \include
for MSDOS).
