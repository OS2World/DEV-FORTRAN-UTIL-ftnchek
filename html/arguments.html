<A NAME="arguments"></A><DT><B><A HREF="arguments.html">-arguments</A>=</B><I>list</I>

<DD>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Controls warnings about
mismatches between actual and dummy subprogram arguments, and also
about mismatches between expected and actual subprogram type.  (An actual
argument is an argument passed to the subprogram by the caller; a
dummy argument is an argument received by the subprogram.)
By default, all warnings are turned on.
<P>

The <I>list</I> consists of keywords separated by commas or colons.
Since all these warnings are on by default, include a keyword prefixed by
<B>no-</B> to turn off a particular warning.
There are three special keywords: <B>all</B> to turn on all the
warnings about arguments, <B>none</B> to turn them all
off, and <B>help</B> to print the list of all the keywords with a brief
explanation of each.
If <I>list</I> is omitted, <B><A HREF="arguments.html">-arguments</A></B> is equivalent to
<B><A HREF="arguments.html">-arguments</A>=all</B>, and <B>-noarguments</B> is equivalent to
<B><A HREF="arguments.html">-arguments</A>=none</B>.
The warning keywords with their meanings are as follows:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>arrayness</B>:

<DD>
warn about inconsistent use of arguments that are arrays.
These warnings can be further controlled by the <B><A HREF="array.html">-array</A></B> option.
<DT><B>type</B>:

<DD>
warn about dummy arguments of a different data type from the actual arguments.
<DT><B>function-type</B>:

<DD>
warn if the invocation assumes the function's return value is a
different type than it actually is.  Also warns if a function is
called as a subroutine, or vice-versa.
<DT><B>number</B>:

<DD>
warn about invoking a subprogram with a different number of arguments
than the subprogram expects.
</DL>
<P>

For compatibility with previous versions of <B>ftnchek</B>,  a numeric
form of this setting is also accepted: the <I>list</I> is replaced by a
number from 0 to 3.  A value of 0 turns all the warnings off,
1 turns on only <B>number</B>, 2 turns on all
except <B>number</B>, and 3 turns all the warnings on.
<P>

This setting does not apply to checking invocations
of intrinsic functions or statement functions, which can
only be turned off by the <B>-nocheck</B> option.
