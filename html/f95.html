<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
This setting provides detailed control over warnings about standard Fortran 77
features that were deleted from the Fortran 95 Standard.  Unlike the
<B><A HREF="f77.html">-f77</A></B> and <B><A HREF="f90.html">-f90</A></B> settings, these warnings apply to syntax
which is legal Fortran 77.  However, since these features have been deleted
from the Standard, it is possible that programs containing
them will be unacceptable to some newer compilers.
<P>

The <I>list</I>
consists of keywords separated by commas or colons.
There are three special keywords: <B>all</B> to turn on all the
warnings about nonstandard extensions, <B>none</B> to turn them all
off, and <B>help</B> to print the list of all the keywords with a brief
explanation of each.
If <I>list</I> is omitted, <B><A HREF="f95.html">-f95</A></B> is equivalent to
<B><A HREF="f95.html">-f95</A>=all</B>, and <B>-nof95</B> is equivalent to
<B><A HREF="f95.html">-f95</A>=none</B>.
The warning keywords with their meanings are as follows.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>real-do</B>:

<DD>
A DO variable of any real numeric type.
<DT><B>pause</B>:

<DD>
The PAUSE statement.
<DT><B>assign</B>:

<DD>
The ASSIGN statement, assigned GOTO, or assigned format.
<DT><B>h-edit</B>:

<DD>
The H edit descriptor in a format.
</DL>
<P>

There is one other Fortran 77 syntax feature that was deleted in
Fortran 95, namely  branching to an ENDIF from outside the
IF block.  However, <B>ftnchek</B> is unable to analyze program
flow, and so it does not provide a warning for this.
