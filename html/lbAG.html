<B>ftnchek</B> includes two mechanisms for changing the
default values of all options:
by defining environment variables
or by creating a preferences file.
When <B>ftnchek</B> starts up,
it looks in its environment for any variables whose names are composed by
prefixing the string
FTNCHEK_
onto the uppercased version of the option
name.  If such a
variable is found, its value is used to specify the default for the
corresponding switch or setting.  In the case of settings (for example,
the <B><A HREF="common.html">-common</A></B> strictness setting)
the value of the environment variable is read as the
default setting value.  In the case of switches, the default switch will
be taken as true or yes unless the environment variable has the value
0 or NO.
<P>

Note that the environment variable name must be constructed with the
full-length option name, which must be in uppercase.  For example, to
make
<B>ftnchek</B> print a source listing by default, set the environment
variable
FTNCHEK_LIST
to 1 or YES or anything other than 0 or NO.
The names
FTNCHEK_LIS
(not the full option name) or
ftnchek_list
(lower case) would not be recognized.
<P>

Here are some examples of how to set environment variables on various
systems.  For simplicity, all the examples set the default <B><A HREF="list.html">-list</A></B>
switch to YES.
<P>






&gt;1. UNIX, Bourne shell:  &gt;$ FTNCHEK_LIST=YES

<BR>

&gt;                        &gt;$ export FTNCHEK_LIST
<P>
&gt;2. UNIX, C shell:       &gt;% setenv FTNCHEK_LIST YES
<P>
&gt;3. VAX/VMS:             &gt;$ DEFINE FTNCHEK_LIST YES
<P>
&gt;4. MSDOS:               &gt;$ SET FTNCHEK_LIST=YES

<P>

After processing any environment variables, ftnchek looks for a
preferences file containing options and settings.
It will search in the following order, using only the
first file found: (1) <I>.ftnchekrc</I> in the current directory, (2)
<I>ftnchek.ini</I> in the current directory, (3) <I>.ftnchekrc</I> in
the user's home directory, (4) <I>ftnchek.ini</I> in the home
directory.  If such a file is found, the options defined in it are
used as defaults in place of the built-in defaults and overriding any
defaults set in the environment..
<P>

Each option or setting in the preferences file must be on a separate
line.  They are given in the same form as on the command line, except
without the initial
dash.
The preferences file can contain blank lines and comments.  Comments
are introduced at any point in a line by a space character (blank or
tab) or the '#' character, and are terminated by the end of the line.
<P>

Command-line options override the defaults set in the environment
or in the preferences file, in  the same way as they
override the built-in defaults.
