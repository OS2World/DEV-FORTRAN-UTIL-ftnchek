This option reduces
the amount of output relating to normal operation, so that error
messages are more apparent.  This option is provided for the
convenience of users who are checking large suites of files.  The
eliminated output includes the names of project files, and the message
reporting that no syntax errors were found.  It also eliminates some
blank lines that are ordinarily included for clarity. (Some of this output is
turned back on by the <B><A HREF="list.html">-list</A></B> and <B><A HREF="symtab.html">-symtab</A></B> options.)  Default
= no.
<P>

Note: the way to remember the difference  between the <B><A HREF="quiet.html">-quiet</A></B>
and <B><A HREF="brief.html">-brief</A></B> is that <B><A HREF="quiet.html">-quiet</A></B> doesn't suppress any
warning-related information, whereas <B><A HREF="brief.html">-brief</A></B> does.
