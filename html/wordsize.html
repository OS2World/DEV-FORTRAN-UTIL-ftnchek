<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Specifies the default word size to be <I>num</I> bytes.  This is the size of
logical and single-precision numeric variables that are not given
explicit precisions.  (Explicit precisions
for non-character variables are an extension to the Fortran 77
Standard, and are given by type declarations such as REAL*8 X.)
Double-precision and complex variables will be twice
this value, and double complex variables four times.
Quad-precision constants and intrinsic function results will be four
times this value.  Note that variables declared as REAL*16 will
be regarded as quad precision only if the word size is 4 bytes.
Default = turn-on = 4 bytes.
<P>

The word size value does not matter for checking
standard-conforming programs that do not declare explicit precisions for
non-character variables or store Hollerith data in variables.  This
setting also does not affect the default size of character variables,
which is always 1 byte.  Hollerith constants also are assumed to
occupy 1 byte per character.
<P>

The word size is used to determine whether truncation occurs in
assignment statements, and to catch precision mismatches in subprogram
argument lists and common block lists.  The exact warnings that are
issued will depend on the status of other flags.  Under both the
<B><A HREF="portability.html">-portability</A>=mixed-size</B> and the <B>-nowordsize</B> flag, any mixing of
explicit with default precision objects (character
expressions not included) is warned about.  This applies to arithmetic
expressions containing both types of objects, and to
subprogram arguments and COMMON variables.
Under control of the <B><A HREF="truncation.html">-truncation</A>=demotion</B> and
<B>promotion</B> options, a warning
is given for assignment of an expression to a shorter variable of the
same type, or for promotion of a lower precision value to higher
precision in an arithmetic expression or an assignment statement.
<P>

Giving a word size of 0, or equivalently, using <B>-nowordsize</B> means that
no default value will be assumed.
This is equivalent to specifying
<B><A HREF="portability.html">-portability</A>=mixed-size</B>.
Use it to find cases of mixing default and explicit
precision, for example to flag places where REAL*8 is treated
as equivalent to DOUBLE PRECISION.
