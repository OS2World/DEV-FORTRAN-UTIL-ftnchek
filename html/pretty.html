<A NAME="pretty"></A><DT><B><A HREF="pretty.html">-pretty</A>=</B><I>list</I>

<DD>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Controls certain messages related to the appearance of
the source code.  These warn about things that might
make a program less readable or be deceptive to the reader.
By default, all warnings are turned on.
<P>

This setting provides detailed control over the warnings about
appearance.  The <I>list</I> consists of keywords
separated by commas or colons.
Since all warnings are on by default, include a keyword prefixed by
<B>no-</B> to turn off a particular warning.
There are three special keywords: <B>all</B> to turn on all the
warnings about misleading appearances, <B>none</B> to turn them all
off, and <B>help</B> to print the list of all the keywords with a brief
explanation of each.
If <I>list</I> is omitted, <B><A HREF="pretty.html">-pretty</A></B> is equivalent to
<B><A HREF="pretty.html">-pretty</A>=all</B>, and <B>-nopretty</B> is equivalent to
<B><A HREF="pretty.html">-pretty</A>=none</B>.
The warning keywords with their meanings are as follows:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>alternate-return</B>:

<DD>
A RETURN statement has a constant specifying an alternate return point
that is not between 0 and the number of dummy arguments that are
labels.  This is legal, and has the same effect as a RETURN with no
alternate return expression, but suggests that the programmer intended
to use an alternate return label that is not provided.
<DT><B>embedded-space</B>:

<DD>
Space embedded in variable names or in multi-character operators such
as **.
<DT><B>continuation</B>:

<DD>
Continuation mark following a comment line.
<DT><B>long-line</B>:

<DD>
Lines (except comments) over 72 columns in width (beyond 72 is
normally ignored by compiler).
<DT><B>missing-space</B>:

<DD>
Lack of space between variable and a preceding keyword.
<DT><B>multiple-common</B>:

<DD>
COMMON block declared in multiple statements.  No warning is given if the
statements are consecutive except for comment lines.
<DT><B>multiple-namelist</B>:

<DD>
NAMELIST declared in multiple statements.  No warning is given if the
statements are consecutive except for comment lines.
<DT><B>parentheses</B>:

<DD>
Parentheses around a variable by itself.  As a subprogram argument,
this makes the argument an expression, not modifiable by the subprogram.
</DL>
<P>

Note that in free source form, extra space and missing space are
forbidden by the Fortran 90 Standard, and are not mere style violations.  In
this case the warnings are replaced by syntax error messages,
and can be turned off only by using <B>-nocheck</B>.
