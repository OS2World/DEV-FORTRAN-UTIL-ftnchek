<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Prints the amount of resources used by <B>ftnchek</B> in processing the
program.  This listing may be useful in analyzing the size and
complexity of a program.  It can also help in choosing larger
sizes for <B>ftnchek</B>'s internal tables if they are too small to
analyze a particular program.
Default = no.
<P>

In this listing, the term ``chunk size'' is the size of the blocks of
memory allocated to store the item in question, in units of the size
of one item, not necessarily in bytes.  When the initially allocated
space is filled up, more memory is allocated in chunks of this size.
The following is an explanation of the items printed:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>Source lines processed:</I>

<DD>
Total number of lines of code, with separate totals for statement
lines and comment lines.  Comment lines include lines with 'C' or '*'
in column 1 as well as blank lines and lines containing only an inline
comment.  Statement lines are all other lines, including lines that
have an inline comment following some code.  Continuation lines are
counted as separate lines.  Lines in include files are counted each
time the file is included.
<DT><I>Total executable statements:</I>

<DD>
Number of statements in the program, other than specification, data,
statement-function, FORMAT, ENTRY, and END statements.
<DT><I>Total number of modules:</I>

<DD>
A module is any external subprogram, including the main program,
subroutines, functions, and block data units.  This count is of
modules defined within the source, not modules referenced.  Statement
functions are not included.  A subprogram with multiple entry points
is only counted once.
<DT><I>Total statement labels defined</I>

<DD>
Number of labels attached to statements (often called statement
numbers).  The total label count for the entire program is given, as well as
the maximum number in any single subprogram.
<DT><I>Max identifier name chars:</I>

<DD>
Number of characters used for storing identifier names.  An identifier
is a variable, subprogram, or common block name.  Local names are
those of local variables in a subprogram, whereas
global names refer
to subprogram and common block names, as well as dummy argument names
and common variable names.  Actual argument text (up to 15 characters
for each argument) is also included here.  The space used for local
names is not recovered at the end of each module, so this number, like
global space,
grows until the whole program is analyzed.  Unfortunately, this figure
may include some text stored more than
once, although a heuristic is used that will avoid duplicates in many
cases.
<DT><I>Max token text chars:</I>

<DD>
A token is the smallest syntactic unit of the FORTRAN language above
the level of individual characters. For instance a token can be a
variable name, a numerical constant, a quoted text string, or a
punctuation character.  Token text is stored while a module is being
processed.  For technical reasons, single-character tokens are not
included in this total.  Items that are not represented in the
symbol table may be duplicated.  The space for token text is recovered
at the end of each module, so this figure represents the maximum for
any one module.
<DT><I>Max local symbols:</I>

<DD>
This is the largest number of entries in the local symbol table for
any module.  Local symbol table entries include all variables and
parameters, common block names, statement functions, external
subprograms and intrinsic functions referenced by the module.  Literal
constants are not stored in the local symbol table.
<DT><I>Max global symbols:</I>

<DD>
This is the number of entries in the global symbol table at the end of
processing.  Global symbol table entries include external subprogram
and common block names.  Intrinsic functions and statement functions
are not included.
<DT><I>Max number of tokenlists:</I>

<DD>
A token list is a sequence of tokens representing the actual or dummy
argument list of a subprogram, or the list of variables in a common
block or namelist.  Therefore this number represents the largest sum
of COMMON, CALL, NAMELIST and ENTRY statements and function invocations for any
one module.  The space is recovered at the end of each module.
<DT><I>Max token list/tree space:</I>

<DD>
This is the largest number of tokens in all the token lists and token
trees of any one module.  A token tree is formed when analyzing an
expression: each operand is a leaf of the tree, and the operators are
the nodes.  Therefore this number is a measure of the maximum
complexity of an individual module.  For instance a module with many
long arithmetic expressions will have a high number.  Note that unlike
token text described above, the number of tokens is independent of the
length of the variable names or literal constants in the expressions.
<DT><I>Number of subprogram invocations:</I>

<DD>
This is the sum over all modules of the number of
CALL statements and function invocations (except intrinsic functions
and statement functions).
<DT><I>Number of common block decls:</I>

<DD>
This is the sum over all modules of the number of common block
declarations.  That is, each declaration of a block in a different
module is counted separately.  (The standard allows multiple
declarations of a block within the same module; these are counted as
only one declaration since they are equivalent to a single long
declaration.)
<DT><I>Number of array dim &amp; param ptrs:</I>

<DD>
This is the sum over all modules of the number of array dimension and
parameter definition text strings saved for use by the
<B><A HREF="makedcls.html">-makedcls</A></B> option.  The length of the text strings is not
counted.  Each dimension of a multidimensional array is counted separately.
</DL>
<P>

These numbers are obviously not the same when project files are used
in place of the original source code.  Even the numbers for global
entities may be different, since some redundant information is
eliminated in project files.
