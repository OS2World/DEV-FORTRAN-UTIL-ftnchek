This switch is used when a number of subprograms are
contained in a file, but not all of them are used by the application.
Normally, <B>ftnchek</B> warns you if any subprograms are defined but
never used.  This switch will suppress these warnings.  Default = no.
<P>

This switch also controls which subprogram calls and COMMON
block declarations are checked.  If a file
is read with the <B><A HREF="library.html">-library</A></B> flag in effect, the subprogram calls
and COMMON declarations contained in a routine in that file will
be checked only if that routine is in the main program's call tree.
On the other hand, if the <B><A HREF="library.html">-library</A></B> switch is
turned off, then <B>ftnchek</B> checks the calls of every routine by
every other routine, regardless of whether those routines could ever
actually be invoked at run time, and likewise all COMMON block
declarations are compared for agreement.
<P>

The difference between this switch and the <B><A HREF="usage.html">-usage</A>=no-ext-unused</B>
option for subprograms is that the latter suppresses only the warning
about routines being declared but not used.  The <B><A HREF="library.html">-library</A></B> switch
goes further and excludes unused routines processed while it is in
effect from all cross-checking of arguments and COMMON block
declarations as well.
<P>

(If there is no main program anywhere in the set of files that
<B>ftnchek</B> has read, so that there is no call tree, then
<B>ftnchek</B> will look for any non-library routines that are not called
by any other routine, and use these as substitutes for the main
program in constructing the call tree and deciding what to check.
If no such top-level non-library routines are found, then
all inter-module calls and all COMMON declarations will be checked.)
