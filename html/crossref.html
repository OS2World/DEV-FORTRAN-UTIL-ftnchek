<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Prints cross-reference tables.  Default = none.
<P>

The <I>list</I> consists of keywords separated by commas or colons.
The keywords with their meanings are as follows:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>calls</B>:

<DD>
table lists each subprogram followed by a list of routines that call
it.  This listing omits library modules that are not in the call tree
of the main program.  The list is alphabetized.
<DT><B>common</B>:

<DD>
table lists each COMMON block followed by a list of the routines that
access it.  These listed routines are those in which some variables in
the COMMON block are accessed, not simply those routines that declare
the block.  (To find out what routines declare a COMMON block but do
not use it, see the <B><A HREF="usage.html">-usage</A></B> flag.)
<DT><B>labels</B>:

<DD>
table lists each label followed by a list of all references to it.  A
label reference is denoted by the line number and statement type of
the referring statement.   The label list is in sequential order.  The
references are listed in the order they are encountered in the program.
