<DD>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Causes <B>ftnchek</B> to print out the call structure of
the complete program.
<P>

The <I>list</I> consists of keywords separated by commas or colons.
There are two special keywords: <B>none</B> to turn off all the
options, and
<B>help</B> to print the list of all the keywords with a brief
explanation of each.  (The keyword <B>all</B> turns on all the
options, but should not normally be used since only one format should
be specified.)
If <I>list</I> is omitted, <B><A HREF="calltree.html">-calltree</A></B> is equivalent to
<B><A HREF="calltree.html">-calltree</A>=tree</B>, and <B>-nocalltree</B> is equivalent to
<B><A HREF="calltree.html">-calltree</A>=none</B>.
By default no call graph is printed.
<P>

If the <A HREF="mkhtml.html">-mkhtml</A> option is invoked <I>and</I> tree is the applied
calltree option, a file named CallTree.html, will also be produced
depicting the tree in HTML format.  This file is useful as a starting
point for browsing the HTML files describing each component of the
program.
<P>

The keywords which control which format is used are as follows:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>tree</B>:

<DD>
produce the call graph in tree format.
<DT><B>reference</B>:

<DD>
produce the call graph in who-calls-who format (same as
<B><A HREF="reference.html">-reference</A></B> switch).
<DT><B>vcg</B>:

<DD>
produce the call graph in VCG format (same as <B><A HREF="vcg.html">-vcg</A></B>
switch).
</DL>
<P>

Only one of the formats <B>tree</B>, <B>reference</B>, or <B>vcg</B> may
be specified.
<P>

The following keywords control options affecting the output:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>prune</B>:

<DD>
prune repeated subtrees (applicable only with <B>tree</B>).  This
the default.
<DT><B>sort</B>:

<DD>
sort children of each routine into alphabetical order.  This is the default.
</DL>
<P>

See the discussion of the <B><A HREF="reference.html">-reference</A></B>
and <B><A HREF="vcg.html">-vcg</A></B> flags for details about these formats.
<P>

For <B>tree</B> format, The call graph is printed out
starting from the main program, which is listed on the first line at
the left margin.  Then on the following lines, each routine called by
the main program is listed, indented a few spaces, followed by the
subtree starting at that routine.
<P>

In the default mode,
if a routine is called by more than one other routine,
its call subtree is printed only the first time it is encountered
Later calls give only the routine name and the notice ``(see above)''.
To have the subtree printed for each occurrence of the routine,
use option <B>no-prune</B>.
<P>

Note that the call tree will be incomplete if any of the input files
are project files containing more than one module
that were created in <B><A HREF="library.html">-library</A></B> mode.  See the
discussion of project files below.
<P>

Technical points: Each list of routines called by a given routine is
printed in alphabetical order unless the <B>no-sort</B> option is given.
If multiple main programs are found, the call tree of each is printed
separately.
If no main program is found, a report to that effect is printed out,
and the call trees of any top-level non-library routines are printed.
This flag only controls the printing of the call tree: <B>ftnchek</B>
constructs the call tree in any case because it is used to determine
which library modules will be cross-checked.  See the discussion
of the <B><A HREF="library.html">-library</A></B> flag.
<P>

For compatibility with previous versions of <B>ftnchek</B>,  a numeric
form of this setting is also accepted: the <I>list</I> is replaced by a
number from 0 to 15.  This number is formed from 1 for
<B>tree</B> format, 2 for <B>reference</B> format, or 3 for <B>vcg</B>
format, plus 4 for <B>no-prune</B>, and 8 for <B>no-sort</B>.
