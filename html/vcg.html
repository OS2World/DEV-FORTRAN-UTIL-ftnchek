Produce the call graph in the form of a VCG graph description.  This
description is written to a separate file, with the same stem as the
file containing the main program, and suffix
<I>.vcg</I>.

This file is able to be given directly to
<B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1L+xvcg">xvcg</A></B>(1L)

to visualize the call graph.
(If input is from the standard input, then the graph description is
sent to standard output.)
This switch is equivalent to <B><A HREF="calltree.html">-calltree</A>=vcg</B>.
Default = no.
<P>

The VCG description as created is more complex than it need be. VCG allows
graphs and nested subgraphs: each subroutine is created as a
subgraph nested inside its calling routines.  This allows you to
interactively display subgraphs or summarise them.
