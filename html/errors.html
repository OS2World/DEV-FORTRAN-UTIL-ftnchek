Set the maximum number of error messages in a ``cascade''.
During checking of agreement of subprogram
arguments, common block declarations, and so forth, sometimes a single
case will generate a long string of warnings.  Often this simply
indicates some other cause than a genuine item-by-item mismatch, such
as for
example a varible missing from one list.  So in such cases
<B>ftnchek</B> stops printing the warnings after the cascade limit is
reached, and the trailer ``etc...'' is printed to indicate that there
were more errors not printed.  If you think that these warnings are
likely to be genuine, use this setting to see more of them.
Turn-on = default = 3, max = 999.  A value of 0 means no limit.
<P>

This setting does not set an overall limit on the number of error
messages printed, only the number printed in any one cascade.  Most
types of warnings and error messages are not subject to the cascade
effect and so are not affected by this setting.  To turn off warnings
generally, use the individual warning control options or the
<B>-nocheck</B> option.
