.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\}
.PP
\fBftnchek\fP (short for Fortran checker)
is designed to detect certain errors in a
Fortran program that a compiler usually does not.
\fBftnchek\fP is not primarily
intended to detect syntax errors.  Its purpose is to assist the user in finding
semantic errors.  Semantic errors are legal in the Fortran language but are
wasteful or may cause incorrect operation.  For example, variables which are
never used may indicate some omission in the program; uninitialized variables
contain garbage which may cause incorrect results to be calculated; and
variables which are not declared may not have the intended type.
\fBftnchek\fP is
intended to assist users in the debugging of their Fortran program.  It is not
intended to catch all syntax errors.  This is the function of the compiler.
Prior to using \fBftnchek\fP,
the user should verify that the program compiles
correctly.

This document first summarizes how to invoke \fBftnchek\fP.
That section should be read before beginning to use \fBftnchek\fP.
Later sections describe \fBftnchek\fP's
options in more detail, give an example of its use, and explain
how to interpret the output.  The final sections mention the limitations
and known bugs in
\fBftnchek\fP.

2 Invoking_Ftnchek
.PP
\}
\fBftnchek\fP is
invoked through a command of the form:
.sp 1
.ce 1
\fC$ ftnchek [-option -option ...] filename [filename ...]\fR
.PP
The brackets indicate something which is optional.  The brackets
themselves are not actually typed.  Here options are command-line
switches or settings, which control the operation of the program and the
amount of information that will be printed out.  If no option is
specified, the default action is to print error messages, warnings,
and informational messages, but not the program listing or symbol tables.
.PP
.ie \nh \{
Each option begins with the '/' character.
(\fBftnchek\fP also allows the '-' character to be used.)
\}
.el \{
Each option begins with the '\-' character.
(On VAX/VMS or MS-DOS systems you may use either '/' or '\-'.)
For the sake of conformity with an increasingly common convention, options can
also begin with '\-\-'.
The options are described at greater length in the next section.
\}
.PP
\fBftnchek\fP options fall into two categories: switches, which are either
true or false, and settings, which have a numeric or string value.  The
name of a switch is prefixed by 'no' or 'no-' to turn it off:
e.g. \fB\-nopure\fP
would turn off the warnings about impure functions. The 'no' prefix
can also be used with numeric settings, having the effect of turning
off the corresponding warnings.
Settings that control lists of warnings have a special syntax discussed
below.
Only the first 3
characters of an option name (not counting
.ie \nh the '/')
.el     the '\-')
need be provided.
A colon may be used in place of an equals sign for numeric or string setting
assignments; however, we show only the equals sign form below.
.if !\nh \{
.PP
The switches and settings which \fBftnchek\fP currently recognizes are
listed below.  For each option, the default is the value used if the
option is not explicitly specified, while the turn-on is the value
used if the option is given without assigning it a value.

will produce a command summary listing all options and settings.
.PP
For settings that take a list of keywords, namely
\fB\-arguments\fP,
\fB\-array\fP,
\fB\-calltree\fP,
\fB\-common\fP,
\fB\-crossref\fP,

\fB\-pretty\fP,
\fB\-project\fP,
\fB\-source\fP,
\fB\-style\fP,
\fB\-truncation\fP,
and
\fB\-usage\fP,
the list consists of keywords
separated by commas or colons.
If the list of keywords is omitted, the
effect is to set the option to its turn-on value (same as ``all'' in most
cases).
Also, if the
list is omitted, the setting name can be prefixed with \fBno\fP or
\fBno\-\fP to
turn off all the options it controls.  For example, \fB\-f77\fP turns
on all warnings about nonstandard constructions, while
\fB\-nof77\fP turns them all off.    Three special keywords are:
.TP
.B help
Print out all the option keywords controlled by the setting,
with a brief explanation of their meanings.
This keyword cannot be given in a list with other keywords.
.TP
.B all
Set all options. This turns on all options controlled by the setting.
.TP
.B none
Clear all options.  This turns off all options controlled by the setting.
.PP
These three special keywords must be given in full.  For all other
keywords, only as many letters of the keyword as are necessary to
identify it unambiguously need be given, or a wildcard pattern
may be used.  Including a keyword in the
list turns the corresponding option on.
For example, \fB\-f77=intrinsic\fP would
turn on only the warnings about use of nonstandard intrinsic functions.
Prefixing a keyword by \fBno\-\fP turns its option off.
For example,
\fB\-pretty=no\-long\-line\fP turns off warnings about lines
exceeding 72 columns in length while leaving all other warnings about
misleading appearance in effect.
If a setting has default \fBnone\fP, you can turn on all options
except one or two by using \fBall\fP first.
For example,
\fB\-f77=all,no\-include\fP enables warnings about all nonstandard
extensions except INCLUDE statements.
If a setting has default \fBall\fP, you can turn off all warnings
except one or two by using \fBnone\fP first.
For example,
\fB\-truncation=none,demotion\fP would turn off all precision related
warnings except about demotions.
Wildcard patterns contain an asterisk to stand for any string of
characters.  If a wildcard pattern is used, all the warnings that
match it are affected.  If \fBno\-\fP is prefixed to the pattern, all
the matching warnings are turned off, otherwise they are all turned
on.  The minimum unambiguous length rule does not apply to wildcard
matching.    For example, use \fB\-usage=no\-*var*\fP to turn off
all warnings relating to variable usage (both local and common).
(Unix users may need to
quote any options containing wildcards in order to prevent the shell
from attempting to expand them.)
Wildcards are recognized only in lists of warning keywords, not in the
top-level options themselves.
.PP
When \fBftnchek\fP starts up, it looks for environment variables
and also for a preferences file.
Any options defined in the environment or in the preferences file are
used as defaults in place of the built-in defaults.  They are
over-ridden by any command line options.
See the section on changing the defaults for details about the
environment options and the preferences file.

This section provides a more detailed discussion of \fBftnchek\fP
command-line options.  Options and filenames may be interspersed on a
command line.  Most options are positional: each option remains in
effect from the point it is
encountered until it is overridden by a later change.  Thus for
example, the listing may be suppressed for some files and not for
others.  Exceptions are: the \fB\-intrinsic\fP, \fB\-pointersize\fP,
and \fB\-wordsize\fP settings, which cannot be
changed once processing of input files has started;
the
\fB\-arguments\fP,

Controls warnings about
mismatches between actual and dummy subprogram arguments, and also
about mismatches between expected and actual subprogram type.  (An actual
argument is an argument passed to the subprogram by the caller; a
dummy argument is an argument received by the subprogram.)
By default, all warnings are turned on.
.PP
The \fIlist\fP consists of keywords separated by commas or colons.
Since all these warnings are on by default, include a keyword prefixed by
\fBno\-\fP to turn off a particular warning.
There are three special keywords: \fBall\fP to turn on all the
warnings about arguments, \fBnone\fP to turn them all
off, and \fBhelp\fP to print the list of all the keywords with a brief
explanation of each.
If \fIlist\fP is omitted, \fB\-arguments\fP is equivalent to
\fB\-arguments=all\fP, and \fB\-noarguments\fP is equivalent to
\fB\-arguments=none\fP.
The warning keywords with their meanings are as follows:
.TP \w'128:'u+2n
.BR arrayness :
warn about inconsistent use of arguments that are arrays.
These warnings can be further controlled by the \fB\-array\fP option.
.TP \w'1.'u+2n
.BR type :
warn about dummy arguments of a different data type from the actual arguments.
.TP \w'1.'u+2n
.BR function\-type :
warn if the invocation assumes the function's return value is a
different type than it actually is.  Also warns if a function is
called as a subroutine, or vice-versa.
.TP \w'1.'u+2n
.BR number :
warn about invoking a subprogram with a different number of arguments
than the subprogram expects.
.PP
For compatibility with previous versions of \fBftnchek\fP,  a numeric
form of this setting is also accepted: the \fIlist\fP is replaced by a

Controls the degree of strictness in checking
agreement between actual and dummy subprogram arguments that are arrays.
The warnings controlled by this setting are for constructions that might
legitimately be used by a knowledgeable programmer, but that often
indicate programming errors.
By default, all warnings are turned on.
.PP
The \fIlist\fP consists of keywords separated by commas or colons.
Since all these warnings are on by default, include a keyword prefixed by
\fBno\-\fP to turn off a particular warning.
There are three special keywords: \fBall\fP to turn on all the
warnings about array arguments, \fBnone\fP to turn them all
off, and \fBhelp\fP to print the list of all the keywords with a brief
explanation of each.
If \fIlist\fP is omitted, \fB\-array\fP is equivalent to
\fB\-array=all\fP, and \fB\-noarray\fP is equivalent to
\fB\-array=none\fP.
The warning keywords with their meanings are as follows:
.TP \w'1.'u+2n
.BR dimensions :
warn if the arguments differ in their number of dimensions,
or if the actual argument is an array element while the dummy argument
is a whole array.
.TP \w'1.'u+2n
.BR size :
warn if both arguments are arrays, but they differ in number
of elements.
.PP
For compatibility with previous versions of \fBftnchek\fP,  a numeric
form of this setting is also accepted: the \fIlist\fP is replaced by a
number from 0 to 3.  A value of 0 turns all the warnings off,
1 turns on only \fBdimensions\fP, 2 turns on only
\fBsize\fP, and 3 turns all the warnings on.
.PP
Note:
A warning is always given regardless of this setting if the actual
argument is an array while the dummy argument is a scalar variable, or
if the actual argument is a scalar variable or expression while the
dummy argument is an array.  These cases are seldom intentional.
(To turn off even these warnings, use \fB\-arguments=no\-arrayness\fP.)
No warning is ever given if the actual argument is an array
element while the dummy argument is a scalar variable.
Variable-dimensioned arrays and arrays dimensioned with 1 or asterisk match any
number of array elements.
There is no check of whether multi-dimensional arrays agree in the
size of each dimension separately.

Selects a shorter format for some warning messages.  At present, the
only warnings controlled by this flag are those that are printed at
the end of processing each subprogram.  These include warnings about
variables that are set but not used or used before set, variable names
that do not conform to the Fortran 77 standard, etc.  (These warnings
may be suppressed entirely depending on other flags, such as the
\fB\-usage\fP or \fB\-f77\fP flags.)  In the default format each
variable is listed on a separate line, along with the line number
where the variable is declared, set or used, according to the nature
of the warning.  The briefer format simply lists all variables to
which the warning applies, with up to 4 variables per line.

Causes \fBftnchek\fP to print out the call structure of
the complete program.
.PP
The \fIlist\fP consists of keywords separated by commas or colons.
There are two special keywords: \fBnone\fP to turn off all the
options, and
\fBhelp\fP to print the list of all the keywords with a brief
explanation of each.  (The keyword \fBall\fP turns on all the
options, but should not normally be used since only one format should
be specified.)
If \fIlist\fP is omitted, \fB\-calltree\fP is equivalent to
\fB\-calltree=tree\fP, and \fB\-nocalltree\fP is equivalent to
\fB\-calltree=none\fP.
By default no call graph is printed.
.PP
If the -mkhtml option is invoked \fIand\fP tree is the applied
calltree option, a file named \fCCallTree.html\fR, will also be produced
depicting the tree in HTML format.  This file is useful as a starting
point for browsing the HTML files describing each component of the
program.
.PP
The keywords which control which format is used are as follows:
.TP \w'1.'u+2n
.BR tree :
produce the call graph in tree format.
.TP \w'1.'u+2n
.BR reference :
produce the call graph in who-calls-who format (same as
\fB\-reference\fP switch).
.TP \w'1.'u+2n
.BR vcg :
produce the call graph in VCG format (same as \fB\-vcg\fP
switch).
.PP
Only one of the formats \fBtree\fP, \fBreference\fP, or \fBvcg\fP may
be specified.
.PP
The following keywords control options affecting the output:
.TP \w'1.'u+2n
.BR prune :
prune repeated subtrees (applicable only with \fBtree\fP).  This
the default.
.TP \w'1.'u+2n
.BR sort :
sort children of each routine into alphabetical order.  This is the default.
.PP
See the discussion of the \fB\-reference\fP
and \fB\-vcg\fP flags for details about these formats.
.PP
For \fBtree\fP format, The call graph is printed out
starting from the main program, which is listed on the first line at
the left margin.  Then on the following lines, each routine called by
the main program is listed, indented a few spaces, followed by the
subtree starting at that routine.
.PP
In the default mode,
if a routine is called by more than one other routine,
its call subtree is printed only the first time it is encountered
Later calls give only the routine name and the notice ``(see above)''.
To have the subtree printed for each occurrence of the routine,
use option \fBno\-prune\fP.
.PP
Note that the call tree will be incomplete if any of the input files
are project files containing more than one module
that were created in \fB\-library\fP mode.  See the
discussion of project files below.
.PP
Technical points: Each list of routines called by a given routine is
printed in alphabetical order unless the \fBno\-sort\fP option is given.
If multiple main programs are found, the call tree of each is printed
separately.
If no main program is found, a report to that effect is printed out,
and the call trees of any top-level non-library routines are printed.
This flag only controls the printing of the call tree: \fBftnchek\fP
constructs the call tree in any case because it is used to determine
which library modules will be cross-checked.  See the discussion
of the \fB\-library\fP flag.
.PP
For compatibility with previous versions of \fBftnchek\fP,  a numeric
form of this setting is also accepted: the \fIlist\fP is replaced by a
number from 0 to 15.  This number is formed from 1 for
\fBtree\fP format, 2 for \fBreference\fP format, or 3 for \fBvcg\fP
format, plus 4 for \fBno\-prune\fP, and 8 for \fBno\-sort\fP.

This switch is provided so that errors and warning messages can be
turned off when \fBftnchek\fP is used for purposes other than finding
bugs, such as making declarations or printing the call tree.  It is
positional, so after turning all checks off, selected checks can be
turned back on.  The effect of \fB\-nocheck\fP is to put all switches,
numeric settings, and settings controlling lists of warnings
to their turn-off values, as if they had all been
specified with the \-no prefix.
Switches and settings that specify
options and modes of operation, rather than controlling warnings, are
unaffected.

Parse errors (syntax errors due to unrecognized or malformed
statements) are not suppressed by this switch, since the results may
be incorrect if \fBftnchek\fP has not parsed the program correctly.
.PP
There are some miscellaneous errors and warning messages that are not
controlled by any other switch, and so can be turned off only by this
switch.  Note that using \fB\-check\fP following \fB\-nocheck\fP only
has the effect of turning these special warnings back on, and does not
restore all the checks it turned off.  These warnings are:
.TP \w'1.'u+2n
o

(e.g. between a keyword and an identifier) or space

This setting controls the strictness of
checking of COMMON blocks.
By default, all warnings except \fBvolatile\fP are turned on.
.PP
The \fIlist\fP consists of keywords separated by commas or colons.
Since most of these warnings are on by default, include a keyword prefixed by
\fBno\-\fP to turn off a particular warning.
There are three special keywords: \fBall\fP to turn on all the
warnings, \fBnone\fP to turn them all
off, and \fBhelp\fP to print the list of all the keywords with a brief
explanation of each.
If \fIlist\fP is omitted, \fB\-common\fP is equivalent to
\fB\-common=dimensions,exact,length,type\fP,
and \fB\-nocommon\fP is equivalent to
\fB\-common=none\fP.
The warning keywords with their meanings are as follows:
.TP \w'1.'u+2n
.BR dimensions :
corresponding arrays in each declaration of a block must
agree in size and number of dimensions.  This option only has an effect
when used together with \fBexact\fP.
.TP \w'1.'u+2n
.BR exact :
the comparison of two blocks is done variable-by-variable rather than
simply requiring agreement between corresponding storage locations.
Use this if all declarations of a given COMMON block are supposed to be
identical, which is a good programming practice.
.TP \w'1.'u+2n
.BR length :
warn if different declarations of the same block are not equal in
total length.
The Fortran 77 Standard requires each named common block, but not
blank common, to be
the same length in all modules of the program.
.TP \w'1.'u+2n
.BR type :
in each declaration of a given COMMON block,
corresponding memory locations (words or bytes) must agree in data type.
If used together with \fBexact\fP, this will require that
corresponding variables agree in data type.
.TP \w'1.'u+2n
.BR volatile :
Assume that COMMON blocks are volatile.
.PP
Many Fortran programmers assume that variables, whether
local or in COMMON, are static, i.e. that
once assigned a value, they retain that value permanently until
assigned a different value by the program.  However, in fact the
Fortran 77 Standard does not require this to be the case.
Local variables may
become undefined between activations of a module in which they are
declared.  Similarly, COMMON blocks may become undefined if no module
in which they are declared is active.  (The technical term for
entities with this behavior is ``automatic'',
but \fBftnchek\fP uses the word ``volatile'' since it
is clearer to the nonspecialist.)  Only COMMON blocks declared
in a SAVE statement, or
declared in the main program or in a block data subprogram remain
defined as long as the program is running.  Variables and COMMON
blocks that can become undefined at some point are called volatile.
.PP
If the \fB\-common=volatile\fP flag is turned on,
\fBftnchek\fP will warn you if it finds
a volatile COMMON block.  If, at the same time, the
\fB\-usage=com\-block\-volatile \fP option is turned on (which is the default),
\fBftnchek\fP will try to check whether
such a block can lose its defined status between activations of the
modules where it is declared.  \fBftnchek\fP does not do a very good job of
this: the rule used is to see whether the block is declared in two
separated subtrees of the call tree.  For instance, this would be the
case if two modules, both called from the main program, shared a
volatile COMMON block.  A block can also become undefined between two
successive calls of the same subprogram, but \fBftnchek\fP is not smart
enough to tell whether a subprogram can be called more than once, so
this case is not checked for.
.PP
The \fB\-common=volatile\fP flag does not affect the way \fBftnchek\fP
checks the usage of local variables.
.PP
For compatibility with previous versions of \fBftnchek\fP,  a numeric
form of this setting is also accepted: the \fIlist\fP is replaced by a
number from 0 to 3.  A value of 0 turns all the warnings off,
1 or greater turns on \fBtype\fP, 2 or greater turns on \fBlength\fP, and
3 turns on \fBdimensions\fP and \fBexact\fP also.  The numeric form
cannot turn on the \fBvolatile\fP option.

not use it, see the \fB\-usage\fP flag.)
.TP

Set the maximum number of error messages in a ``cascade''.
During checking of agreement of subprogram
arguments, common block declarations, and so forth, sometimes a single
case will generate a long string of warnings.  Often this simply
indicates some other cause than a genuine item-by-item mismatch, such
as for
example a varible missing from one list.  So in such cases
\fBftnchek\fP stops printing the warnings after the cascade limit is
reached, and the trailer ``\fCetc...\fR'' is printed to indicate that there
were more errors not printed.  If you think that these warnings are
likely to be genuine, use this setting to see more of them.
Turn-on = default = 3, max = 999.  A value of 0 means no limit.
.PP
This setting does not set an overall limit on the number of error
messages printed, only the number printed in any one cascade.  Most

effect and so are not affected by this setting.  To turn off warnings
generally, use the individual warning control options or the

then any instances where implicit parameter typing occurs will be
warned about.
If you want to be warned only in those instances
where the implicit data type differs from the default type, use
\fB\-portability=param\-implicit\-type\fP instead.  According to the Fortran
77 standard, the data type of a parameter is given by the same rules
as for a variable, and if necessary a type conversion is done when the
value is assigned.
.TP
.BR  param\-intrinsic :
Intrinsic function or exponentiation by a real used to define the value
of a \fCPARAMETER\fR definition.
.TP
.BR  param\-noparen :
\fCPARAMETER\fR statement without parentheses.  The user should be
aware that the semantics of this form of the statement differs from
that of the standard form: in this form, the parameter takes its data
type from the value assigned, rather than having its default data type
based on the first letter of the parameter name.  (This form of the
\fCPARAMETER\fR statement was introduced by DEC before the Fortran 77
standard was defined, and should be avoided.)
.TP
.BR  pointer :
``Cray pointer'' syntax.
.TP
.BR  quad\-constant :
Quad precision real constants, e.g. of the form \fC1.23Q4\fR.
.TP
.BR  quotemark :
Strings delimited by quote marks rather than apostrophes.
.TP
.BR  relops :
Relational (comparison) operators composed of punctuation, namely: <
<= == /= > >=.
.TP
.BR  semicolon :
Semicolon used as statement separator.
.TP
.BR  statement\-order
Statements out of the sequence mandated by the Standard.  The allowed
sequence is illustrated in Table 1 in the section on Interpreting the
Output.
.TP
.BR  typeless\-constant :
Typeless constants, for example \fCZ'19AF'\fR.
.TP
.BR  type\-size :
Type declarations specifying a size, for example \fCREAL*8\fR.

.BR  variable\-format :
Variable repeat specification or field size in FORMAT.  These
are of the form \fC<\fR \fIexpr\fP \fC>\fR.

This setting provides detailed control over the warnings about
supported extensions to the Fortran 77 Standard that were not adopted
as part of the Fortran 90 Standard.  Note that \fBftnchek\fP does not
support the full Fortran 90 language.  However, it does support some
common extensions to Fortran 77 that were prevalent before Fortran 90
was defined.  Some of these extensions became part of the Fortran 90
Standard, but others did not.  The \fB\-f90\fP setting warns only
about the latter.  That is, this flag covers things that are neither legal
Fortran 77 nor legal Fortran 90.  Therefore, the warnings controlled
by this flag are basically a subset of the warnings controlled by
\fB\-f77\fP.  There are a few cases, described below, where the
circumstances in which the warning is given are slightly different for
the two flags.
.PP
The \fIlist\fP
consists of keywords separated by commas or colons.
There are three special keywords: \fBall\fP to turn on all the
warnings about nonstandard extensions, \fBnone\fP to turn them all
off, and \fBhelp\fP to print the list of all the keywords with a brief
explanation of each.
If \fIlist\fP is omitted, \fB\-f90\fP is equivalent to
\fB\-f90=all\fP, and \fB\-nof90\fP is equivalent to
\fB\-f90=none\fP.

The following keywords have identical meanings for \fB\-f90\fP as for
\fB\-f77\fP.  The reader is referred to the explanations under \fB\-f77\fP.

The keywords which differ somewhat from the corresponding
\fB\-f77\fP keywords are as follows.
.TP \w'128:'u+2n
.BR continuation :
The limit on the number of continuation lines for a statement in
fixed source form is the
same, namely 19, in Fortran 90 as in Fortran 77.  For free
source form the limit is 39 continuation lines, and a line containing
a continuation mark cannot be otherwise empty or contain only a comment.
.TP
.BR  intrinsic :
This is the same as for \fB\-f77\fP except for the intrinsic
functions defined in MIL-STD 1753, which are all included in Fortran
90, and so are not warned about.  (See \fB\-intrinsic\fP for a list.)
.TP
.BR io\-keywords :
This is the same as for \fB\-f77\fP except that no warnings are given
for the I/O keywords that are standard in Fortran 90.
.TP
.BR  long\-line :
Although the Fortran 90 Standard allows lines longer than 72
characters in free source form, this restriction still applies to fixed
source form.  In free source form the line length limit is 132 characters,
and unlike fixed form, \fBftnchek\fP does not allow this limit to
be increased.
.TP
.BR  mixed\-expr :
This is the same as for \fB\-f77\fP except for expressions mixing
extended precision real with complex data types, which are permitted
in Fortran 90.
.TP
.BR  statement\-order :
This is similar to the corresponding \fB\-f77\fP warning, but applies
the somewhat looser restrictions on statement order of the
Fortran 90 Standard.  In particular, Fortran 90 allows \fCDATA\fR
statements and statement-function definitions to be intermixed with
specification statements.
.TP
.BR  typeless\-constant :
In Fortran 90, binary, octal, and hexadecimal constants of the form
\fCB'ddd'\fR, \fCO'ddd'\fR, and \fCZ'ddd'\fR, respectively, are
permitted.  Here \fC'ddd'\fR represents a string of digits.
\fBftnchek\fP recognizes these forms, as well as a variant of the form
\fCX'ddd'\fR for a
hexadecimal constant, and other variants in which the base indicator
\fCB\fR, \fCO\fR, \fCZ\fR, or \fCX\fR
follows the digit string.  These variants were not adopted in
Fortran 90, so only they are warned about when this flag is turned on.

This setting provides detailed control over warnings about standard Fortran 77
features that were deleted from the Fortran 95 Standard.  Unlike the
\fB\-f77\fP and \fB\-f90\fP settings, these warnings apply to syntax
which is legal Fortran 77.  However, since these features have been deleted
from the Standard, it is possible that programs containing
them will be unacceptable to some newer compilers.
.PP
The \fIlist\fP
consists of keywords separated by commas or colons.
There are three special keywords: \fBall\fP to turn on all the
warnings about nonstandard extensions, \fBnone\fP to turn them all

If \fIlist\fP is omitted, \fB\-f95\fP is equivalent to
\fB\-f95=all\fP, and \fB\-nof95\fP is equivalent to
\fB\-f95=none\fP.
The warning keywords with their meanings are as follows.

There is one other Fortran 77 syntax feature that was deleted in
Fortran 95, namely  branching to an \fCENDIF\fR from outside the
\fCIF\fR block.  However, \fBftnchek\fP is unable to analyze program
flow, and so it does not provide a warning for this.

Define non-alphanumeric characters that may be used in identifiers.
By default, \fBftnchek\fP only accepts the dollar sign and underscore
as non-alphanumeric characters in identifier names.  The characters in
the \fIlist\fP replace whatever set of accepted non-alphanumeric characters
was previously in effect.  Thus, if dollar sign or underscore are not
included in the list, they lose their status as acceptable characters.
.PP
This option is provided to enable \fBftnchek\fP to handle source files
containing non-standard identifer names that may be needed, for
example, to access certain operating system services.  See the section

Controls whether \fBftnchek\fP recognizes certain nonstandard

to recognize certain groups of functions, and other keywords
control the expected syntax for invoking
some nonstandard intrinsics.
Include a keyword to turn on recognition of the corresponding
set of intrinsics or to allow the corresponding syntax.  Include a
keyword prefixed by
\fBno\-\fP to turn off that recognition.
.PP
There are three special keywords: \fBall\fP  turns on recognition of
all the nonstandard intrinsics (listed below) and accepts either syntax for
those that have variations.
Use \fBnone\fP to turn off recognition of all nonstandard intrinsics
except those noted below.
Use \fBhelp\fP to print the list of all the keywords with a brief
explanation of each.
If \fIlist\fP is omitted, \fB\-intrinsic\fP is equivalent to
\fB\-intrinsic=all\fP, and \fB\-nointrinsic\fP is equivalent to

.TP
.BR  rand\-one\-argument :
specify that \fCRAND\fR and \fCIRAND\fR may be invoked with one
argument.
.PP
The \fBno\-argument\fP and \fBone\-argument\fP keywords work as
follows: turning the option on causes \fBftnchek\fP to accept the
corresponding syntax for invocation of the function, without excluding
the possibility of the alternative syntax.  Turning the option off
causes the corresponding syntax not to be accepted.  If both options
are turned on at once (the default), then either syntax is accepted.
Turning both options off at once would not be meaningful.
These options have no effect if recognition of Unix intrinsics has
been turned off.
.PP
Note that this setting does not control whether non-standard warnings
are issued about these functions.  It controls whether the
functions are assumed to be intrinsic or not, which determines how their
usage is checked.  When functions in any of these sets are
included, their invocations will be checked according to the rules
for the intrinsic functions; otherwise they will be checked as normal
(user-written) external functions.  The non-standard warnings
are controlled by the \fB\-f77=intrinsic\fP option.
.PP
The default value of this setting is equivalent to
.ie \nh \{
/intrinsic=all,no-unix.
\}
.el \{
\fB\-intrinsic=all\fP followed by \fB\-intrinsic=no\-vms\fP for the
Unix version, \fB\-intrinsic=no\-unix\fP for the VMS version,
and \fB\-intrinsic=no\-unix,no\-vms\fP for other versions.
\}
.PP
Note: In versions of \fBftnchek\fP prior to 2.10, the
\fB\-intrinsic\fP flag took a numeric argument instead of a list of
options.
For the sake of users who may have written scripts invoking
\fBftnchek\fP in this way, the numeric form is still
accepted.  The numeric form of the setting consists of three digits.
The
ones digit selects the set of intrinsic functions to be supported.
The digit 0 selects only Fortran 77 standard intrinsics plus those needed to
support the nonstandard extended precision data types.  The digit 1 is
equivalent to \fBextra\fP, 2 is
equivalent to \fBextra,unix\fP, and 3 is equivalent to
\fBextra,vms\fP.
The tens digit of this setting controls the syntax of the \fCRAND\fR
intrinsic function, and the hundreds
digit controls the syntax of the \fCIARGC\fR function.
For these digits,
specify 0 to require invocation with no argument,
1 to require one argument, and 2 to allow either form.

This switch is used when a number of subprograms are
contained in a file, but not all of them are used by the application.
Normally, \fBftnchek\fP warns you if any subprograms are defined but
never used.  This switch will suppress these warnings.  Default = no.
.PP
This switch also controls which subprogram calls and COMMON
block declarations are checked.  If a file
is read with the \fB\-library\fP flag in effect, the subprogram calls
and COMMON declarations contained in a routine in that file will
be checked only if that routine is in the main program's call tree.
On the other hand, if the \fB\-library\fP switch is
turned off, then \fBftnchek\fP checks the calls of every routine by
every other routine, regardless of whether those routines could ever
actually be invoked at run time, and likewise all COMMON block
declarations are compared for agreement.
.PP
The difference between this switch and the \fB\-usage=no\-ext\-unused\fP
option for subprograms is that the latter suppresses only the warning
about routines being declared but not used.  The \fB\-library\fP switch
goes further and excludes unused routines processed while it is in
effect from all cross-checking of arguments and COMMON block
declarations as well.
.PP
(If there is no main program anywhere in the set of files that
\fBftnchek\fP has read, so that there is no call tree, then
\fBftnchek\fP will look for any non-library routines that are not called
by any other routine, and use these as substitutes for the main
program in constructing the call tree and deciding what to check.
If no such top-level non-library routines are found, then
all inter-module calls and all COMMON declarations will be checked.)

Prepare a neatly-formatted file of declarations of variables,
common blocks, and namelist lists, for possible
merging into the source code.  The declarations are stored in a file
of the same name as the source code, but with the extension changed to
.IR .dcl .
If no declarations are written to the file, it is deleted to reduce
clutter from empty files.
.PP
If input comes from standard input, instead of a named file, then
declarations are written to standard output.
.PP
Variables are declared in alphabetical order within each declaration
class and type, with integer variables first, because of their later
possible use in array dimensions.
.PP
\fCPARAMETER\fR statements are an exception to the alphabetical order
rule, because the Fortran 77 Standard requires that the expressions
defining parameter values refer only to constants and already-defined
parameter names.  This forces the original source file order of such
statements to be preserved in the declaration files.
.PP
Explicit declaration of
.I all
variables is considered good modern programming practice.  By using
compiler options to reject undeclared variables, misspelled variable
names (or names extending past column 72) can be caught at compile
time.  Explicit declarations also greatly facilitate changing
floating-point precision with filters such as
.BR dtoq (1L),
.BR dtos (1L),
.BR fd2s (1L),
.BR fs2d (1L),
.BR qtod (1L),
and
.BR stod (1L).
These programs are capable of changing types of explicit
floating-point type declarations, intrinsic functions, and constants,
but because they do not carry out rigorous lexical and grammatical
analysis of the Fortran source code, they cannot provide modified type
declarations for undeclared variables.
Default setting = 0, turn-on = 1.
.PP
Various options for the form of the declarations file are controlled
by the \fIlist\fP, which consists of keywords
separated by commas or colons.
There are three special keywords: \fBall\fP to turn on all the
options, \fBnone\fP to turn them all
off, and \fBhelp\fP to print the list of all the keywords with a brief
explanation of each.
If \fIlist\fP is omitted, \fB\-makedcls\fP is equivalent to
\fB\-makedcls=declarations\fP (i.e. produce the declarations file
using the default options), and
\fB\-nomakedcls\fP is equivalent to \fB\-makedcls=none\fP.
.PP
For compatibility with previous versions of \fBftnchek\fP, a numeric
form of this setting is also accepted:  the \fIlist\fP is replaced by
a number which is the sum of the numbers in parentheses beside
the keywords in the following list.
The warning keywords with their meanings are as follows:
.TP \w'128:'u+2n
\fBdeclarations\fR (1):
Write a declaration file.  (This is implied by any of the other
options, and can be omitted if any other options are given.)
.TP
\fBundeclared\-only\fR (2):
By default, all variables are included in the declaration file.  With
this option, include only
.I undeclared
variables.  This setting is useful if you want to check for undeclared
variables, since Fortran source files with all variables properly
declared will not result in a
.I .dcl
file.
With this option, common blocks and namelist lists will not be
included in the declaration file, since by their nature they cannot be
undeclared.
.TP
\fBcompact\fR (4):
The declarations are normally prettyprinted to line up neatly in
common columns, as in the declaration files output by the Extended
PFORT Verifier,
.BR pfort (1L).
This option value selects instead compact output, without column
alignment.
.TP
\fBuse\-continuation\-lines\fR (8):
Causes continuation lines to be used where permissible.
The default is to begin a new declaration on each line.  This option
is appropriate to use together with \fBcompact\fR.
.TP
\fBkeywords\-lowercase\fR (16):
Output Fortran keywords in lowercase, instead of the default
uppercase.
.TP
\fBvars\-and\-consts\-lowercase\fR (32):
Output variables and constants in lowercase, instead of the default
uppercase.   Character string constants are not affected by this
option.
.TP
\fBexclude\-sftran3\fR (64):
Omit declarations of internal integer variables produced by the
SFTRAN3 preprocessor,
.BR xsf3 (1L),
as part of the translation of structured Fortran statements to
ordinary Fortran.  These variables have six-character names of the
form
.IR NPRddd ,
.IR NXdddd ,
.IR N2dddd ,
and
.IR N3dddd ,
where
.I d
is a decimal digit.  Because they are invisible in the SFTRAN3 source
code, and will change if the SFTRAN3 code is modified, such variables
should not be explicitly declared.  Instead, they should just assume
the default Fortran INTEGER data type based on their initial letter,
.IR N .
.TP
\fBasterisk\-comment\fR (128):
Use an asterisk as the comment character; the default is otherwise 'C'.
.TP
\fBcomment\-char\-lowercase\fR (256):
Use 'c' instead of 'C' or '*' as the comment character.
.TP
\fBsuppress\-array\-dimensions\fR (512):
Suppress dimensioning of arrays in the generated declarations.
This option is for use with code lacking type declarations, to allow
the declaration files to be inserted without change into the code.  Since
the code will have dimension statements already, dimensioning the
array variables in the type statements of the declaration file is redundant.
This option should be used only in conjunction with
option 2 = undeclared-only because otherwise any arrays that were
dimensioned in a type statement will lose their dimensioning.
.TP
\fBfree\-form\fR (1024):
Produce declarations in free source form.  This mode is automatically
used if the input source is free form.  Use this option to produce
declarations in free form even if the input is in fixed form.  Free
form declarations are indented only 2 columns instead of 6, use the
exclamation mark as the comment character, and indicate continuation
lines by an ampersand at the end of the line to be continued.
.PP
The declaration files contain distinctive comments that mark the start
and end of declarations for each program unit, to facilitate using
text editor macros for merging the declarations back into the source
code.
.PP
The \fBftnchek\fP distribution includes a program, \fBdcl2inc\fP,
which processes declaration files to produce files containing
declarations of all COMMON blocks, in a form suitable for use as
INCLUDE files.  See the

For the sake of simplicity, the options for \fB\-mkhtml\fP are the

.TP
\fBcompact\fR (4):
The declarations are normally prettyprinted to line up neatly in
common columns.
This option value selects instead compact output, without column
alignment.
.TP
\fBuse\-continuation\-lines\fR (8):
Causes continuation lines to be used instead of
beginning a new declaration on each line.  This option
is appropriate to use together with \fBcompact\fR.
.TP
\fBkeywords\-lowercase\fR (16):
Output Fortran keywords in lowercase, instead of the default
uppercase.
.TP
\fBvars\-and\-consts\-lowercase\fR (32):
Output variables and constants in lowercase, instead of the default
uppercase.   Character string constants are not affected by this
option.
.TP
\fBexclude\-sftran3\fR (64):
Omit declarations of internal integer variables produced by the
SFTRAN3 preprocessor,
.BR xsf3 (1L).
(See \fB\-makedcls\fP for discussion.)
.TP
\fBsuppress\-array\-dimensions\fR (512):
Suppress dimensioning of arrays in the generated declarations.  This
is normally undesirable, but is available if for some reason you
do not want the array dimensions to appear in the HTML.
.TP
\fBfree\-form\fR (1024):
Produce variable declarations in free source form.  This mode is automatically
used if the input source is free form.  This mainly affects the form
of continuation lines if they are used.

(a)
provides an extra message to the effect that a function

\fBftnchek\fP will give warnings for a variety of
non-portable usages.  Examples include the use of tabs except in comments
or inside strings, the use of Hollerith constants, and the
equivalencing of variables of different data types.  This option does
not produce warnings for supported extensions to the Fortran 77 Standard, which
may also cause portability problems.  To catch those, use
the \fB\-f77\fP setting.
By default, all warnings are turned off.
.PP
This setting provides detailed control over the warnings about
possible portability problems.  The \fIlist\fP consists of keywords
separated by commas or colons.
There are three special keywords: \fBall\fP to turn on all the
warnings about nonportable usages, \fBnone\fP to turn them all
off, and \fBhelp\fP to print the list of all the keywords with a brief
explanation of each.
If \fIlist\fP is omitted, \fB\-portability\fP is equivalent to
\fB\-portability=all\fP, and \fB\-noportability\fP is equivalent to
\fB\-portability=none\fP.
The warning keywords with their meanings are as follows:
.TP \w'128:'u+2n
.BR  backslash :
Backslash character in strings.  Since some compilers treat the
backslash as an escape character, its presence can cause problems even
though it is used in a standard-conforming way.
.TP
.BR  common\-alignment :
COMMON block variables not in descending order of storage size.  Some
compilers require this ordering because of storage alignment requirements.
.TP
.BR  hollerith :
Hollerith constants (other than within FORMAT
specifications).  The Hollerith data type is a feature of Fortran IV
that has been deleted in the Fortran 77 standard.  It is superseded
by the character data type.  Storing Hollerith data in variables of a
numeric or logical data type is nonportable due to differing word sizes.
.TP
.BR  long\-string :
String constants, variables, or expressions over 255 chars long.
.TP
.BR  mixed\-equivalence :
Variables of different data types equivalenced.
.TP
.BR  mixed\-size :
Variables declared with default precision used with variables given
explicit precision, in expressions, assignments, or as arguments.  For
example, if a variable declared as \fCREAL*8\fR is treated as
equivalent to \fCDOUBLE PRECISION\fR.
.TP
.BR  real\-do :
Non-integer DO loop index and bounds.  These can cause a program's
results to depend on the hardware characteristics of the particular
computer used.
.TP
.BR param\-implicit\-type :
Implicit typing of a parameter by the data type of the value assigned,
if it differs from the default type.  This warning can only occur if
implicit parameter typing has been turned on by the
\fB\-source=param\-implicit\-type\fP option, or
if the \fCPARAMETER\fR statement is of the nonstandard form without
parentheses.  If this option is turned on,
then any instances where implicit parameter typing
occurs and where the implicit type is different from the default type based
on the first letter of the parameter name, will be warned
about.  Implicit parameter typing can change the
semantics of statements where the parameter is used, causing
portability problems.
.TP
.BR  tab :
Tabs in source code.  Tabs are interpreted differently by different
compilers.  This warning will be given only once, at the end of the
file.

Controls certain messages related to the appearance of
the source code.  These warn about things that might
make a program less readable or be deceptive to the reader.
By default, all warnings are turned on.
.PP
This setting provides detailed control over the warnings about
appearance.  The \fIlist\fP consists of keywords
separated by commas or colons.
Since all warnings are on by default, include a keyword prefixed by
\fBno\-\fP to turn off a particular warning.
There are three special keywords: \fBall\fP to turn on all the
warnings about misleading appearances, \fBnone\fP to turn them all
off, and \fBhelp\fP to print the list of all the keywords with a brief
explanation of each.
If \fIlist\fP is omitted, \fB\-pretty\fP is equivalent to
\fB\-pretty=all\fP, and \fB\-nopretty\fP is equivalent to
\fB\-pretty=none\fP.
The warning keywords with their meanings are as follows:
.TP \w'128:'u+2n
.BR  alternate\-return :
A RETURN statement has a constant specifying an alternate return point
that is not between 0 and the number of dummy arguments that are
labels.  This is legal, and has the same effect as a RETURN with no
alternate return expression, but suggests that the programmer intended
to use an alternate return label that is not provided.
.TP
.BR  embedded\-space :
Space embedded in variable names or in multi-character operators such
as \fC**\fR.
.TP
.BR  continuation :
Continuation mark following a comment line.
.TP
.BR  long\-line :
Lines (except comments) over 72 columns in width (beyond 72 is
normally ignored by compiler).
.TP
.BR  missing\-space :
Lack of space between variable and a preceding keyword.
.TP
.BR  multiple\-common :
COMMON block declared in multiple statements.  No warning is given if the
statements are consecutive except for comment lines.
.TP
.BR  multiple\-namelist :
NAMELIST declared in multiple statements.  No warning is given if the
statements are consecutive except for comment lines.
.TP
.BR  parentheses :
Parentheses around a variable by itself.  As a subprogram argument,
this makes the argument an expression, not modifiable by the subprogram.
.PP
Note that in free source form, extra space and missing space are
forbidden by the Fortran 90 Standard, and are not mere style violations.  In
this case the warnings are replaced by syntax error messages,
and can be turned off only by using \fB\-nocheck\fP.

explanation of each.
If \fIlist\fP is omitted, \fB\-project\fP is equivalent to

\fB\-project=none\fP.
The keywords with their meanings are as follows:
.TP \w'128:'u+2n
\fBcreate\fP:
Produce a project file.  The default is not to produce a project
file.  If this option is not turned on, the other options have no effect.
.TP
\fBtrim\-calls\fP:
Trim the amount of information stored in the project file about
subprogram declarations and calls.  This is the default.  Turn this
option off only in rare situations.  (See discussion below.)
The amount of trimming varies depending on the \fB\-library\fP flag.
More information is trimmed if that flag is turned on.
.TP
\fBtrim\-common\fP:
Trim the number of common block declarations stored in the project
file.  This is the default.  Turn this option off only in rare
situations.  (See discussion below.)
This option has no effect if the \fB\-library\fP flag is turned off:
when not in library mode, no trimming of common block declarations is
done regardless of this option.
.PP
A project file contains a summary of information from the source file,
for use in checking agreement
among \fCFUNCTION\fR, \fCSUBROUTINE\fR, and \fCCOMMON\fR
usages in other files.  It
allows incremental checking, which saves time whenever you have a
large set of files containing shared subroutines, most of which seldom
change.  You can run \fBftnchek\fP once on each file with the
\fB\-project\fP flag set, creating the project files.  Usually you
would also set the \fB\-library\fP and \fB\-noextern\fP flags at this
time, to suppress messages relating to consistency with other files.
Only error messages pertaining to each file by itself will be printed
at this time.  Thereafter, run \fBftnchek\fP without these flags on all
the project files together, to check consistency among the different
files.  All messages internal to the individual files will now be
omitted.  Only when a file is altered will a new project file need to
be made for it.
.PP
Naturally, when the \fB\-project\fP option is turned on, \fBftnchek\fP will not
read project files as input.
.PP
Ordinarily, the trim options should be left on when you intend to
create project files for future input to \fBftnchek\fP.  Since trimming
is on by default, this means that simply giving the command
\fB\-project\fP with no option list is the recommended mode.  The trim
options are provided only as a convenience for those who want to make
use of project files for purposes other than checking the program with
\fBftnchek\fP.  To use project files for their intended purpose, the
trim options should not be turned off.
.PP
Project files contain only information needed for checking
agreement between files.  This means that a project file is of no use if all
modules of the complete program are contained in a single file.

Assume functions are ``pure'', i.e., they will not have
side effects by modifying their arguments or variables in a COMMON
block.  When this flag is in effect, \fBftnchek\fP will base its
determination of set and used status of the actual arguments on the
assumption that arguments passed to a function are not altered.  It
will also issue a warning if a function is found to modify any of its
arguments or any COMMON variables.
Default = yes.
.PP
When this flag is turned off, actual arguments passed to functions
will be handled the same way as actual arguments passed to
subroutines.  This means that \fBftnchek\fP will assume that arguments
may be modified by the functions.  No warnings will be given if a
function is found to have side effects.  Because stricter checking is
possible if functions are assumed to be pure, you should turn this flag
off only if your program actually uses functions with side effects.

Default = no.
.PP
In this listing, the term ``chunk size'' is the size of the blocks of
memory allocated to store the item in question, in units of the size
of one item, not necessarily in bytes.  When the initially allocated
space is filled up, more memory is allocated in chunks of this size.
The following is an explanation of the items printed:
.TP \w'1.'u+2n
.I "Source lines processed:"
Total number of lines of code, with separate totals for statement
lines and comment lines.  Comment lines include lines with 'C' or '*'
in column 1 as well as blank lines and lines containing only an inline
comment.  Statement lines are all other lines, including lines that
have an inline comment following some code.  Continuation lines are
counted as separate lines.  Lines in include files are counted each
time the file is included.
.TP \w'1.'u+2n
.I "Total executable statements:"
Number of statements in the program, other than specification, data,
statement-function, FORMAT, ENTRY, and END statements.
.TP \w'1.'u+2n
.I "Total number of modules:"
A module is any external subprogram, including the main program,
subroutines, functions, and block data units.  This count is of
modules defined within the source, not modules referenced.  Statement
functions are not included.  A subprogram with multiple entry points
is only counted once.
.TP \w'1.'u+2n
.I "Total statement labels defined"
Number of labels attached to statements (often called statement
numbers).  The total label count for the entire program is given, as well as
the maximum number in any single subprogram.
.TP \w'1.'u+2n
.I "Max identifier name chars:"
Number of characters used for storing identifier names.  An identifier
is a variable, subprogram, or common block name.  Local names are
those of local variables in a subprogram, whereas
global names refer
to subprogram and common block names, as well as dummy argument names
and common variable names.  Actual argument text (up to 15 characters
for each argument) is also included here.  The space used for local
names is not recovered at the end of each module, so this number, like
global space,
grows until the whole program is analyzed.  Unfortunately, this figure
may include some text stored more than
once, although a heuristic is used that will avoid duplicates in many
cases.
.TP \w'1.'u+2n
.I "Max token text chars:"
A token is the smallest syntactic unit of the FORTRAN language above
the level of individual characters. For instance a token can be a
variable name, a numerical constant, a quoted text string, or a
punctuation character.  Token text is stored while a module is being
processed.  For technical reasons, single-character tokens are not
included in this total.  Items that are not represented in the
symbol table may be duplicated.  The space for token text is recovered
at the end of each module, so this figure represents the maximum for
any one module.
.TP \w'1.'u+2n
.I "Max local symbols:"
This is the largest number of entries in the local symbol table for
any module.  Local symbol table entries include all variables and
parameters, common block names, statement functions, external
subprograms and intrinsic functions referenced by the module.  Literal
constants are not stored in the local symbol table.
.TP \w'1.'u+2n
.I "Max global symbols:"
This is the number of entries in the global symbol table at the end of
processing.  Global symbol table entries include external subprogram
and common block names.  Intrinsic functions and statement functions
are not included.
.TP \w'1.'u+2n
.I "Max number of tokenlists:"
A token list is a sequence of tokens representing the actual or dummy
argument list of a subprogram, or the list of variables in a common
block or namelist.  Therefore this number represents the largest sum
of COMMON, CALL, NAMELIST and ENTRY statements and function invocations for any
one module.  The space is recovered at the end of each module.
.TP \w'1.'u+2n
.I "Max token list/tree space:"
This is the largest number of tokens in all the token lists and token
trees of any one module.  A token tree is formed when analyzing an
expression: each operand is a leaf of the tree, and the operators are
the nodes.  Therefore this number is a measure of the maximum
complexity of an individual module.  For instance a module with many
long arithmetic expressions will have a high number.  Note that unlike
token text described above, the number of tokens is independent of the
length of the variable names or literal constants in the expressions.
.TP \w'1.'u+2n
.I "Number of subprogram invocations:"
This is the sum over all modules of the number of
CALL statements and function invocations (except intrinsic functions
and statement functions).
.TP \w'1.'u+2n
.I "Number of common block decls:"
This is the sum over all modules of the number of common block
declarations.  That is, each declaration of a block in a different
module is counted separately.  (The standard allows multiple
declarations of a block within the same module; these are counted as
only one declaration since they are equivalent to a single long
declaration.)
.TP \w'1.'u+2n
.I "Number of array dim & param ptrs:"
This is the sum over all modules of the number of array dimension and
parameter definition text strings saved for use by the
\fB\-makedcls\fP option.  The length of the text strings is not
counted.  Each dimension of a multidimensional array is counted separately.
.PP
These numbers are obviously not the same when project files are used
in place of the original source code.  Even the numbers for global
entities may be different, since some redundant information is
eliminated in project files.

One of the goals of the \fBftnchek\fP program is to

This setting controls certain options about the form of the Fortran

There are three special keywords: \fBall\fP to turn on all the
options, \fBnone\fP to turn them all
off, and \fBhelp\fP to print the list of all the keywords with a brief
explanation of each.
If \fIlist\fP is omitted, \fB\-source\fP is equivalent to
\fB\-source=all\fP, and \fB\-nosource\fP is equivalent to
\fB\-source=none\fP.
.PP
For compatibility with previous versions of \fBftnchek\fP, a numeric
form of this setting is also accepted:  the \fIlist\fP is replaced by
a number which is the sum of the numbers in parentheses beside
the keywords in the following list.  (The \fBfixed\fP and \fBfree\fP
options do not have numeric values.)
The warning keywords with their meanings are as follows:
.TP \w'128:'u+2n
\fBfixed\fP:
Interpret the source as fixed form (with supported extensions such as
exclamation mark for comments).  Statements must be in columns 7 to 72
(unless the \fB\-cols\fP setting has been used to change this), and
blanks are not significant outside character context (but warned
about under the \fB\-pretty\fP option).  This is the default mode
unless the source file extension is \fI.\|f90\fP or \fI.\|F90\fP.
this option cannot be given together with \fB\-source=free\fP.
.TP
\fBfree\fP:
Interpret the source as free form.  Statements may be anywhere in
columns 1 to 132, comments can only begin with an exclamation mark,
and blanks are required in some places such as between identifiers and
keywords.  This is the default mode if the source
file extension is \fI.\|f90\fP or \fI.\|F90\fP.  This option cannot be given
together with \fB\-source=fixed\fP or \fB\-source=dec\-tab\fP
.TP
\fBdec\-tab\fP (1):
Accept DEC-style tab-formatted source.  A line beginning with an
initial tab will be treated as a new statement line unless the
character after the tab is a nonzero digit, in which case it is
treated as a continuation line.  The next column after the
tab or continuation mark is taken as column 7.  A warning will be
given in the case where the line is a continuation, if
\fB\-f77=dec\-tab\fP is in effect.
.TP
\fBvms\-include\fP (2):
Accept VMS-style \fCINCLUDE\fR statements.  These follow the normal
syntax, but with the following additional features: (1) the file
extension, if not given, defaults to the same as a normal source file
extension; and (2) the option \fC/LIST\fR or \fC/NOLIST\fR can be
appended to the include-file name, to control listing of its contents.
.TP
\fBunix\-backslash\fP (4):
Handle UNIX-style backslash escapes in character strings.
The escape sequence following the backslash will be evaluated
according to the ANSI standard for strings in C: up to three digits signify
an octal value, an x signifies the start of a hexadecimal constant,
any of the letters a b f n r t signify special control codes, and any
other character (including newline) signifies the character itself.
When this source code option is in effect,
a warning will be given if the \fB\-f77=backslash\fP
setting is specified.
.IP
The default behavior is to treat the backslash
like any other normal character, but a warning about
portability will be generated if the \fB\-portability\fP flag is set.
Because of the fact that some compilers treat the backslash in a
nonstandard way, it is possible for standard-conforming programs to be
non-portable if they use the backslash character in strings.
.IP
Since \fBftnchek\fP does not do much with the interpreted string, it
is seldom necessary to use this option.  It is needed in order to
avoid spurious warnings only if (a) the program being checked uses
backslash to embed an apostrophe or quote mark in a string
instead of using the standard mechanism of doubling the delimiter; (b)
the backslash is used to escape the end-of-line in order to continue
a string across multiple source lines; or (c) a \fCPARAMETER\fR
definition uses an intrinsic string function such as \fCLEN\fR with
such a string as argument, and that value is later used to define
array dimensions, etc.
.TP
\fBparam\-implicit\-type\fP (8):
Implicit typing of a parameter by the data type of the value assigned.
Some non-standard compilers may allow the data type of the value to
override the
Fortran 77 default type of a parameter that is based on the first
letter of the parameter name.  This option only applies to
\fCPARAMETER\fR statements of the standard form which has parentheses.
A parameter that has been
explicitly declared in a type statement prior to the \fCPARAMETER\fR
statement is not affected by this option.  A warning will be given
under the \fB\-f77=param\-implicit\-type\fP or
\fB\-portability=param\-implicit\-type\fP option.
.IP
Note that this implicit typing is treated as equivalent to an explicit
type declaration for the parameter.  Therefore, if you use

variables, these parameters will \fInot\fP be included.

\fBdec\-param\-standard\-type\fP (16):
Follow the Fortran 77 rule for data typing of DEC Fortran style
parameters.  These are declared using a nonstandard form of the
\fCPARAMETER\fR statement which lacks parentheses.  According to DEC
Fortran, parameters defined by this form of the statement have their
data type given by the data type of the value assigned.  Use this
option to tell \fBftnchek\fP not to follow this rule but instead to use the
same rule as for standard \fCPARAMETER\fR statements.  This option
does not apply to \fCPARAMETER\fR statements of the standard form.

.BR  block\-if :
Complain about arithmetic IF statement.  Accept block IF or logical IF
(which controls a single statement).
.TP
.BR  construct\-name :
Complain about unnamed block constructs: IF,
DO, and SELECT CASE.  Note that if a construct name is present on the
opening statement of a construct, then it is required to be present on
all other component statements (ELSE, END IF, etc.) of the construct.
In that case a missing construct name on those statements generates a

.BR  goto :
Complain about the presence of unconditional, computed or assigned
GOTO statements.  Also complain about alternate returns (but not about
labels as subprogram arguments).

.BR  labeled\-stmt :
Complain about the presence of labels (numbers) on statements other

The warning keywords with their meanings are as follows:
.TP \w'128:'u+2n
.BR  int\-div\-exponent :
use of the result of integer division as an exponent.
This suggests that a real quotient is intended.
An example would be writing \fCX**(1/3)\fR to evaluate the cube root
of \fCX\fR. The correct expression is \fCX**(1./3.)\fR.
.TP
.BR  int\-div\-real :
Conversion of an expression involving an integer division to real.
This suggests that a real quotient is intended.
.TP
.BR  int\-div\-zero :
division in an integer constant expression that
yields a result of zero.
.TP
.BR  int\-neg\-power :
exponentiation of an integer by a negative
integer (which yields zero unless the base integer is 1 in magnitude).
This suggests that a real base is intended.
.TP
.BR  promotion :
automatic conversion of a lower precision quantity to one of higher
precision.  The loss of accuracy for real variables in this process is
comparable to the corresponding demotion.  No warning is given for
promotion of integer quantities to real since this is ordinarily
exact.
.TP
.BR  real\-do\-index :
use of a non-integer DO index in a
loop with integer bounds.
An integer DO index with real bounds is always
warned about regardless of this setting.
.TP
.BR  real\-subscript :
use of a non-integer array subscript.
.TP
.BR  significant\-figures :
overspecifying a single precision constant.  This may indicate that a
double precision constant was intended.
.TP
.BR  size\-demotion :
automatic conversion of a higher precision quantity to one of lower
precision of the same type.  This warning only occurs when an explicit
size is used in declaring the type of one or both operands in an
assignment.  For example, a warning wil be issued where a \fCREAL*8\fR
variable is assigned to a \fCREAL\fR variable, if the default wordsize
of 4 is in effect.  A warning is also issued if a long integer is
assigned to a shorter one, for example, if an \fCINTEGER\fR
expression is assigned to an \fCINTEGER*2\fR variable.  There is one
exception to this last case, namely if the right hand side of the assignment
is a small literal constant (less than 128).
.BR  type\-demotion :
automatic conversion of a higher precision quantity to one of lower
precision of different type.  This warning includes conversion of real
quantities to integer, double precision to single precision real, and
assignment of a longer character string to a shorter one.
.PP
The warnings about promotion and demotion also apply to complex
constants, considering the precision to be that of the real or
imaginary part.
Warnings about promotions and demotions are given only when
the conversion is done automatically, e.g. in expressions of mixed
precision or in an assignment statement.  If intrinsic
functions such as \fCINT\fR are used to perform the conversion, no warning
is given.

Warn about unused or possible uninitialized variables,
unused common blocks, undefined or unused statement labels, and unused or undefined subprograms.
By default, all warnings are
turned on.
.PP
This setting provides detailed control over the warnings about
possible usage errors.  The \fIlist\fP consists of keywords
separated by commas or colons.
Since all warnings are on by default, include a keyword prefixed by
\fBno\-\fP to turn off a particular warning.
There are three special keywords: \fBall\fP to turn on all the
warnings about usage, \fBnone\fP to turn them all
off, and \fBhelp\fP to print the list of all the keywords with a brief
explanation of each.
If \fIlist\fP is omitted, \fB\-usage\fP is equivalent to
\fB\-usage=all\fP, and \fB\-nousage\fP is equivalent to
\fB\-usage=none\fP.
These warnings cover four main categories of objects: subprogram dummy
arguments, common blocks and variables, subprograms and functions, and
local variables.  Warnings include undefined items, multiply defined
items, unused items, etc.
The warning keywords with their meanings are as follows:
.TP \w'128:'u+2n
.BR  arg\-alias :
a scalar dummy argument is actually the same as another and is (or may be)
modified.  The Fortran 77 standard (section 15.9.3.6) prohibits
modifying an argument that is aliased to another.
.TP
.BR  arg\-array\-alias :
a dummy argument which is an array or array element is in the same array as
another and is modified.  This flag is similar to \fBarg\-alias\fP but
provides separate control over array arguments.  It is harder to
tell if aliasing is occurring in the case of arrays, so if
\fBftnchek\fP gives too many false warnings, this flag allows the
array-related ones to be turned off without suppressing the warnings
for scalars.
.TP
.BR  arg\-common\-alias :
a scalar dummy argument is the same as a common variable in the
subprogram, and either is modified.  This is also prohibited by the
Fortran 77 standard.  If common checking is not exact (see the
\fB\-common\fP setting), it is harder to tell if aliasing is
occurring, so the warning is
given if the variable is anywhere in a common block that is declared
by the subprogram.
.TP
.BR  arg\-common\-array\-alias :
a dummy argument which is an array or array element is in the same
array as a common variable, and either is modified.  If common
checking is not exact, the variable can be anywhere in a common block
that is declared by the subprogram.
.TP
.BR  arg\-const\-modified :
a subprogram modifies an argument which is a constant or an
expression.  Such an action could cause anomalous behavior of the program.
.TP
.BR arg\-unused :
a dummy argument is declared but never used.  This is similar to the
\fBvar\-unused\fP keyword described below, but applies only to arguments.
.TP
.BR  com\-block\-unused :
a common block is declared but none of the variables in it are
used by any subprogram.
This warning is suppressed if the common strictness setting is 0.
.TP
.BR  com\-block\-volatile :
a common block may lose the definition of its contents if common
blocks are volatile.  This option only has an effect if the
\fB\-common=volatile\fP flag is in effect.  See the discussion of the
\fB\-common\fP setting above.
.TP
.BR  com\-var\-set\-unused :
a common variable is assigned a value, but its value is not used by
any subprogram.
This warning is suppressed if the common strictness setting is 0.
.TP
.BR  com\-var\-uninitialized :
a common variable's value is used in some subprogram, but is not set
anywhere.
Unfortunately, \fBftnchek\fP does
not do a thorough enough analysis of the calling sequence to know
which routines are called before others.  So warnings about this type
of error will only be given for cases in which a variable is used in
some routine but not set in any other routine.   Checking of
individual COMMON variables is done only if the \fB\-common\fP
setting is 3 (variable by variable agreement).
This warning is suppressed if the common strictness setting is 0.
.TP
.BR  com\-var\-unused :
a common variable is declared but not used by any subprogram.
This warning is suppressed if the common strictness setting is 0.
.TP
.BR  do\-index\-modified :
a variable that is the index of a DO loop is modified by some
statement within the range of the loop.  The Standard permits an
active DO variable to be modified only by the incrementation mechanism
of the DO statement.
.TP
.BR  ext\-multiply\-defined :
an external (a subroutine or function) is defined more than once.
Definition of an external means providing the body of its source code.
.TP
.BR  ext\-declared\-only :
a name is declared in an \fCEXTERNAL\fR statement in some module, but
is not defined or used anywhere.
.TP
.BR  ext\-undefined :
an external is used (invoked) but not defined anywhere.  This option
is equivalent to the \fB\-external\fP flag.  If the subprogram is
invoked more than once, those invocations will still be checked for
consistency.
.TP
.BR  ext\-unused :
an external is defined (its subprogram body is present) but it is not
used.  A subprogram is considered unused even if it is
invoked by some other subprogram, if it cannot be called from any thread
of execution starting with the main program.
The agreement of the subprogram's
arguments with its invocations is still checked even if this warning is
turned off.
If there is no main program, then this warning is issued only if the
subprogram is not invoked anywhere.
This warning is suppressed in library mode, but library mode has the
additional effect of suppressing argument checking for unused routines.
.TP
.BR label\-undefined :
a statement refers to a label that has not been defined.
.TP
.BR label\-unused :
a statement label is defined, but never referred to.
.TP
.BR  var\-set\-unused :
a local variable is assigned a value, but that value is not used.
.TP
.BR  var\-uninitialized :
a local variable's value may be used before it is assigned.
Sometimes \fBftnchek\fP makes a mistake in the warnings about local
variable usage.  Usually it errs on the side of giving a warning where no
problem exists, but in rare cases it may fail to warn where the
problem does exist.  See the section on Bugs for examples.  If
variables are equivalenced, the rule used by \fBftnchek\fP is that a
reference to any variable implies the same reference to all variables
it is equivalenced to.  For arrays, the rule is that a reference to
any array element is treated as a reference to all elements of the array.
.TP
.BR  var\-unused :
a local variable is declared (for instance, in a type declaration) but
is not used in the module.  Does not apply to dummy arguments: warnings
about them are controlled by the keyword \fBarg\-unused\fP described above.
.PP
Note: In versions of \fBftnchek\fP prior to 2.10, the
\fB\-usage\fP flag took a numeric argument instead of a list of
options.
For the sake of users who may have written scripts invoking
\fBftnchek\fP in this way, the numeric form is still
accepted.  The numeric setting is composed of three digits.  The first
digit (hundreds
place) controls warnings about subprograms (functions and
subroutines), the second digit (tens place) warnings about common
blocks and common variables,, and the third digit (ones place)
warnings about local variables.  Each digit controls warnings
according to the convention that a 1 means warn about undefined items
and variables that are used before set,
a 2 means warn about items that are unused, and a 3 means warn about
both types.  These numbers are now converted to the appropriate
values for the above-listed keywords, except for \fBcom\-block\-volatile\fP,
which is not affected by the numeric argument.

Specifies the default word size to be \fInum\fP bytes.  This is the size of
logical and single-precision numeric variables that are not given
explicit precisions.  (Explicit precisions
for non-character variables are an extension to the Fortran 77
Standard, and are given by type declarations such as \fCREAL*8 X\fR.)
Double-precision and complex variables will be twice
this value, and double complex variables four times.
Quad-precision constants and intrinsic function results will be four
times this value.  Note that variables declared as \fCREAL*16\fR will
be regarded as quad precision only if the word size is 4 bytes.
Default = turn-on = 4 bytes.
.PP
The word size value does not matter for checking
standard-conforming programs that do not declare explicit precisions for
non-character variables or store Hollerith data in variables.  This
setting also does not affect the default size of character variables,
which is always 1 byte.  Hollerith constants also are assumed to
occupy 1 byte per character.
.PP
The word size is used to determine whether truncation occurs in
assignment statements, and to catch precision mismatches in subprogram
argument lists and common block lists.  The exact warnings that are
issued will depend on the status of other flags.  Under both the
\fB\-portability=mixed\-size\fP and the \fB\-nowordsize\fP flag, any mixing of
explicit with default precision objects (character
expressions not included) is warned about.  This applies to arithmetic
expressions containing both types of objects, and to
subprogram arguments and COMMON variables.
Under control of the \fB\-truncation=demotion\fP and
\fBpromotion\fP options, a warning
is given for assignment of an expression to a shorter variable of the
same type, or for promotion of a lower precision value to higher
precision in an arithmetic expression or an assignment statement.
.PP
Giving a word size of 0, or equivalently, using \fB\-nowordsize\fP means that
no default value will be assumed.
This is equivalent to specifying
\fB\-portability=mixed\-size\fP.
Use it to find cases of mixing default and explicit
precision, for example to flag places where \fCREAL*8\fR is treated

\fBftnchek\fP includes two mechanisms for changing the
default values of all options:
by defining environment variables
or by creating a preferences file.
When \fBftnchek\fP starts up,
it looks in its environment for any variables whose names are composed by
prefixing the string
\fCFTNCHEK_\fR
onto the uppercased version of the option
name.  If such a
variable is found, its value is used to specify the default for the
corresponding switch or setting.  In the case of settings (for example,
the \fB\-common\fP strictness setting)
the value of the environment variable is read as the
default setting value.  In the case of switches, the default switch will
be taken as true or yes unless the environment variable has the value
\fC0\fR or \fCNO\fR.
.PP
Note that the environment variable name must be constructed with the
full-length option name, which must be in uppercase.  For example, to
make
\fBftnchek\fP print a source listing by default, set the environment
variable
\fCFTNCHEK_LIST\fR
to \fC1\fR or \fCYES\fR or anything other than \fC0\fR or \fCNO\fR.
The names
\fCFTNCHEK_LIS\fR
(not the full option name) or
\fCftnchek_list\fR

After processing any environment variables, ftnchek looks for a
preferences file containing options and settings.
It will search in the following order, using only the

\fIftnchek.\|ini\fP in the current directory, (3) \fI.\|ftnchekrc\fP in
the user's home directory, (4) \fIftnchek.\|ini\fP in the home

used as defaults in place of the built-in defaults and overriding any
defaults set in the environment..

.el \{
.SH "USING PROJECT FILES"
\}
This section contains detailed information on how to use project files
most effectively, and how to avoid some pitfalls.
.PP
One can divide the checks
\fBftnchek\fP does into two categories, local and global.  Local
checking is restricted to within a single routine,
and catches things like uninitialized variables, unintended loss
of precision in arithmetic expressions, etc.  This sort of checking
can be done on each subprogram independently.  Furthermore,
local checking of a subprogram does not need to be repeated when some other
subprogram is changed.  Global checking catches things like calling a
subroutine with the wrong argument types, or disagreeing in common
block declarations.  It requires looking at the whole set of subprograms
interacting with each other.
.PP
The purpose of project files is to allow the local checking and global
checking steps to be separated.  Assuming that each subprogram is in
its own source file, you can run \fBftnchek\fP once on each one to do local
checking while suppressing global checking.
Then \fBftnchek\fP can be run once on all the project
files together to do the global checking.  The sample makefile below
shows how to automate this task.  The ``\fC.f.prj\fR'' target updates a
project file for a particular file any time the source file changes.
The information needed for global checking is saved
in the project file.
The ``\fCcheck\fR'' target does the combined global checking.
Typically ``\fCmake check\fR'' would repeat the ``\fCftnchek
-project\fR'' step only on changed source
files, then do the global check.  This is obviously a big advantage
for large programs, when many subprograms seldom if ever change.
.PP
It is best when using project files to place each subprogram
in a separate source file.  If each source file may contain more than one
subprogram,  it complicates the definition of ``local'' and ``global''
checking because there is some inter-module checking that is contained
within a file.  \fBftnchek\fP tries to do the right thing in this
case, but there are some complications (described below) due to the
trade-off between avoiding re-doing cross-checks and preserving
information about the program's structure.
.PP
Ordinarily, to do the least amount of re-checking, project files should be
created with the \fB\-library\fP
flag in effect and trimming turned on.  In this mode,
the information saved in the project file consists of all subprogram
declarations, all subprogram invocations not resolved by declarations in the
same file, and one instance of each COMMON
block declaration.  This is the minimum amount of information needed
to check agreement between files.
.PP
If the source file contains more than one routine, there are some
possible problems that can arise from creating the project file in
library mode, because the calling
hierarchy among routines defined within the file is lost.  Also,
if the routines in the file make use of COMMON
blocks that are shared with routines in other files, there will not be
enough information saved for the correct checking of set and used
status of COMMON blocks and COMMON variables according to the
\fB\-usage\fP setting.  Therefore if
you plan to use project files when \fB\-usage\fP
checking is turned on (which is the default situation), and if
multiple routines in one
project file share COMMON blocks with routines in other files,
the project files
should be created with the \fB\-library\fP flag turned off.
In this mode, \fBftnchek\fP saves, besides
the information listed above, one invocation of each subprogram by
any other subprogram in the same file, and all COMMON block
declarations.  This means that the project file will be larger than
necessary, and that when it is read in, \fBftnchek\fP may repeat some
inter-module checks that it already did when the project file was
created.  If each project file contains only one
module, there is no loss of information in creating the project
files in library mode.
.PP
Because of the possible loss of information entailed by creating a project file
with the \fB\-library\fP flag in effect, whenever that project file is read
in later, it will be treated as a library file regardless of the
current setting of the \fB\-library\fP flag.  On the other hand, a project
file created with library mode turned off can be read in later in either
mode.
.PP
The foregoing discussion assumes that the trimming options of the
\fB\-project\fP setting are turned on when the project file is
created.  This is the normal situation.  The \fBno\-trim\fP options of
the \fB\-project\fP setting are provided in case one wants to use the
project files for purposes other than checking the program with
\fBftnchek\fP.  For instance, one could write a Perl script to analyze
the project files for information about how the different subprograms
are called.  You should not use the \fBno\-trim\fP options to deal
with the issues of information loss discussed above, since they cause
more information than necessary to be stored.  This makes the project
files bigger and causes \fBftnchek\fP to do more work later when it reads
them to check your complete program.  Ordinarily, you should use the
\fB\-library\fP option to control how much information to store for
later use by \fBftnchek\fP in checking your program.
.if !\nh \{
.PP
Here is an example of how to use the UNIX \fBmake\fP utility to
automatically create a new project file each time the corresponding
source file is altered, and to check the set of files for consistency.
Add these lines to your \fCmakefile\fR.
The example assumes that a macro \fCOBJS\fR has been defined which
lists all the names of object files to be linked together to form the
complete executable program.
(In this \fCmakefile\fR, the indented lines should each begin with a
tab, not blanks.)
If any source file contains multiple routines that share
common blocks among themselves, then the \fCno-com-\\*\fR option
should be removed from \fCNOGLOBAL\fR, and/or drop the \fC-library\fR flag.
.nf
\fC
    # tell make what a project file suffix is
    .SUFFIXES: .prj

    # these options suppress global checks.
    NOGLOBAL=-usage=no-ext-undefined,no-com-\\*

    # tell make how to create a .prj file from a .f file
    .f.prj:
            ftnchek -project $(NOGLOBAL) -library $<

    # set up macro PRJS containing project filenames
    PRJS= $(OBJS:.o=.prj)

    # "make check" will check everything that has been changed.
    check: $(PRJS)
            ftnchek $(PRJS)
\fR
.fi
.PP
When a program uses many routines defined in a large number of
different source files in different directories, it can be
cumbersome to specify all the different project files needed to check
the program properly.  To deal with such cases, \fBftnchek\fP allows
project files to be concatenated into a single large file.  This
single file can then be given to \fBftnchek\fP to provide the
information for checking the use of any or all of the routines defined
in the combined project files.  When using such a ``library''
project file, you may want \fBftnchek\fP's error reports to document
precisely the name of the file where the specific function is defined.
If the various source files are in several directories,
an error report that gives only the file name may be ambiguous, and rather
should include the path to the file.  The solution is to create
each of the individual project files by giving the complete path to
the source file.  Then this complete path will appear in the error
reports.  For example, suppose that all of the library subprogram
source files are in subdirectories of a directory named
\fC/util/lib\fR.  Then the individual project files
could first be created by a command such as
.nf
\fC
find /util/lib -name '*.f' -exec ftnchek -project '{}' ';'
\fR
.fi
(Possibly other options would be provided to \fBftnchek\fP as
discussed above.  Also, this step could be handled instead by a
revised \fCmakefile\fR rule that would provide the complete
source file path instead of just the local name when invoking
\fBftnchek\fP.)  Next, concatenate all of these project files manually.
.nf
\fC
find /util/lib -name '*.prj' -exec cat '{}' ';' > ourlib.prj
\fR
.fi
Then a program source file can be checked by using the command
.nf
\fC
ftnchek prog.f ... -lib ourlib.prj
\fR
.fi
and an error message related to any library routine will include
the full path to the routine's source file.
.PP
At present, there is no archive utility like \fBar\fR to manage the
contents of a concatenated project file like the one in the
illustration above.  If changes are made to one of the library
routines, the only way to update the combined project file is to
concatenate all the individual project files once again.  Such a
utility would be quite easy to write.  Someone should do so and
contribute it to the \fBftnchek\fP effort.

.SH "AN EXAMPLE"
The following simple Fortran program illustrates the messages given by
\fBftnchek\fP.
The program is intended to accept an array of test scores
and then compute the average for the series.
.PP
.nf
\fC
.so average.f
\fR
.fi
.PP
The compiler gives no error messages when this program is compiled.
Yet here is what happens when it is run:
.PP
.nf
\fC
$ run average
70
90
85
<EOF>
$
\fR
.fi
.PP
What happened?  Why didn't the program do anything?
The following is the output from
\fBftnchek\fP when it is used to debug the above
program:

.PP
.nf
\fC

$ ftnchek -list -symtab average
.so average.out
\fR
.fi
.PP
According to \fBftnchek\fP,
the program contains variables which may be
used before they are assigned an initial value, and variables which
are not needed.  \fBftnchek\fP also warns the user that an integer
quotient has been converted to a real. This may assist the user in
catching an unintended roundoff error.  Since the \fB\-symtab\fP flag
was given, \fBftnchek\fP prints out a table containing identifiers from
the local module and their corresponding datatype and number of
dimensions.  Finally, \fBftnchek\fP warns that the function
\fCCOMPAV\fR is not used
with the proper type of arguments.
.PP
With \fBftnchek\fP's
help, we can debug the program.  We can see that there
were the following errors:
.TP \w'1.'u+2n
1.
\fCSUM\fR and \fCCOUNT\fR
should have been converted to real before doing the division.
.TP \w'1.'u+2n
2.
\fCSUM\fR should have been initialized to 0 before entering the loop.
.TP \w'1.'u+2n
3.
\fCAVG\fR was never printed out after being calculated.
.TP \w'1.'u+2n
4.
\fCNUMS\fR should have been declared \fCINTEGER\fR
instead of \fCREAL\fR.
.PP
We also see that \fCI\fR, not \fCJ\fR, should have been declared
\fCINTEGER\fR in function \fCCOMPAV\fR. Also, \fCMAXNOS\fR was not
declared as \fCINTEGER\fR, nor \fCCOMPAV\fR as \fCREAL\fR, in
program \fCAVENUM\fR.  These are not errors, but they may indicate
carelessness.  As it happened, the default type of these variables
coincided with the intended type.
.PP
Here is the corrected program, and its output when run:
.PP
.nf
\fC
.so correct.f
$ run average

<EOF>
AVERAGE =   81.66666

With \fBftnchek\fP's
help, our program is a success!

.SH "INTERPRETING THE OUTPUT"
The messages given by
\fBftnchek\fP include not only
syntax errors but also warnings and informational messages
about things that are legal Fortran but that may indicate errors or
carelessness.
Most of these messages can be turned off by
command-line options.  Which option controls each message
depends on
the nature of the condition being warned about.  See the
descriptions of the command-line flags in the previous sections,
and of individual messages below.
Each message is prefixed with a word or phrase indicating the nature
of the condition and its severity.
.PP
``Error'' means a syntax error.  The simplest
kind of syntax errors are typographical errors, for example unbalanced
parentheses or misspelling of a keyword.  This type of error is caught
by the parser and appears with the description ``parse error'' or
``syntax error'' (depending on whether the parser was built using GNU
\fBbison\fP or UNIX \fByacc\fP respectively).
This type of error message cannot be
suppressed.  Be aware that this type of error often means
that \fBftnchek\fP has not properly interpreted the statement where the
error occurs, so that its subsequent checking operations will be
compromised.  You should eliminate all syntax errors before proceeding to
interpret the other messages \fBftnchek\fP gives.
.PP
``Warning: Nonstandard syntax'' indicates an extension to Fortran that
\fBftnchek\fP supports but that is not according to the Fortran 77 Standard.
The extensions that \fBftnchek\fP accepts
are described in the section on Extensions below.
One example is the \fCDO\fR ... \fCENDDO\fR construction.
If a program uses these extensions, warnings will be
given according to specifications under the \fB\-f77\fP setting.
The default behavior is to give no warnings.
.PP
``Warning'' in other cases
means a condition that is suspicious but that may or may not
be a programming error.  Frequently these conditions are legal under
the standard.  Some are illegal but do not fall under the heading
of syntax errors.
Usage errors are one example.
These refer to the possibility that a variable may be used before
it has been assigned a value (generally an error),
or that a variable is declared but never used (harmless but may
indicate carelessness).
The amount of checking for usage errors is controlled by
the \fB\-usage\fP flag, which specifies
the maximum amount of checking by default.
.PP
Truncation warnings cover situations in which accuracy may be lost
unintentionally, for example when a double precision value is assigned
to a real variable.  These warnings are controlled by the
\fB\-truncation\fP setting, which is on by default.
.PP
``Nonportable usage'' warns about some feature that may not be
accepted by some compilers even though it is not contrary
to the Fortran 77 Standard, or that may cause the program to perform
differently on different platforms.
For example, equivalencing real
and integer variables is usually a non-portable practice.
The use of extensions to the standard language is, of course, another
source of non-portability, but this is handled as a separate case.  To
check a program for true portability, both the \fB\-portability\fP and
the \fB\-f77\fP flags should be used.  They are both turned off by
default.  The \fB\-wordsize\fP setting is provided to check only those
nonportable usages that depend on a particular machine wordsize.
.PP
``Possibly misleading appearance'' is used for legal constructions that may not
mean what they appear to mean at first glance.  For example, Fortran is
insensitive to blank space, so extraneous space within variable names
or the lack of space between a keyword and a variable can convey the wrong
impression to the reader.
These messages can be suppressed by turning off the \fB\-pretty\fP
flag, which is on by default.
.PP
Other messages that are given after all the files are processed,
and having to do with agreement between modules, do not use the word
``warning'' but generally fall into that category.
Examples include type mismatches between corresponding variables in
different COMMON
block declarations, or between dummy and actual arguments of a
subprogram.
These warnings are controlled by the \fB\-common\fP and
\fB\-arguments\fP settings respectively.  By default both are set for
maximum strictness of checking.
.PP
Another group of warnings about conditions that are often harmless
refer to cases where the array properties of a variable
passed as a subprogram argument differ between the two routines.
For instance, an array element might be passed to a subroutine that
expects a whole array.  This is a commonly-used technique for
processing single rows or columns of two-dimensional arrays.
However, it could also indicate a programming error.  The
\fB\-array\fP setting allows the user to adjust the degree of
strictness to be used in checking this kind of agreement between
actual and dummy array arguments.  By default
the strictness is maximum.
.PP
``Oops'' indicates a technical
problem, meaning either a bug in \fBftnchek\fP or that its resources have
been exceeded.
.PP
The syntax error messages and warnings include
the filename along with the line number and column
number.  \fBftnchek\fP has two different options for the
appearance of these error messages.  If \fB\-novice\fP is in effect,
which is the default,
the messages are in a style approximating
normal English.  (In default style, the filename is
not printed in messages within the body of the program if \fB\-list\fP is in
effect.)  The other style of error messages is selected by the
\fB\-nonovice\fP option.  In this
style, the appearance of the messages is similar to that of the
UNIX \fBlint\fP program.
.PP
\fBftnchek\fP is still blind to some kinds of syntax errors.
The two most important ones are detailed checking of \fCFORMAT\fR statements,
and almost anything to do with control of execution
flow by means of \fCIF\fR, \fCDO\fR,
and \fCGOTO\fR statements: namely correct nesting of control structures,
matching of opening statements such as \fCIF\fR ... \fCTHEN\fR with
closing statements such as \fCENDIF\fR, and the proper use of
statement labels (numbers).  Most compilers will catch these errors.
See the section on Limitations for a more detailed discussion.
.PP
If \fBftnchek\fP gives you a syntax error message when the compiler does
not, it may be because your program contains an extension to
standard Fortran which is accepted by the compiler but not by
\fBftnchek\fP.  (See the section on Extensions.)
On a VAX/VMS system, you can use the compiler option \fC/STANDARD\fR
to cause the compiler to accept only standard Fortran.
On most UNIX or UNIX-like systems, this can be accomplished by
setting the flag \fB\-ansi.\fP
.PP
Many of the messages given by \fBftnchek\fP are self-explanatory.
Those that need some additional explanation are listed below in
alphabetical order.
.TP
.I "Common block NAME: data type mismatch at position n"
The \fIn\fP-th variable in the COMMON block differs in data type
in two different declarations of the COMMON block.  By default
(\fB\-common\fP strictness level 3), \fBftnchek\fP is very picky about
COMMON blocks: the variables listed in them must match exactly
by data type and array dimensions.  That is, the legal pair of
declarations in different modules:
.nf
\fC     COMMON /COM1/ A,B\fR
and
\fC     COMMON /COM1/ A(2)\fR
.fi
.br
will cause \fBftnchek\fP to give warnings at strictness level 3.  These
two declarations are legal in Fortran since they both declare two real
variables.  At strictness level 1 or 2, no warning would be given in
this example, but the warning would
be given if there were a data type mismatch, for instance, if \fCB\fR
were declared \fCINTEGER\fR.
Controlled by \fB\-common\fP setting.

.TP
.I "Common block NAME has long data type following short data type"
Some compilers require alignment of multi-byte items so that each item
begins at an address that is a multiple of the item size.  Thus if a
short (e.g. single-precision real) item is followed by a long (e.g.
double precision real) item, the latter may not be aligned correctly.
Controlled by \fB\-portability=common\-alignment\fP option.

.TP
.I "Common block NAME has mixed character and non-character variables"
The ANSI standard requires that if any variable in a COMMON
block is of type \fCCHARACTER\fR, then all other variables in the
same COMMON block must also be of type \fCCHARACTER\fR.
Controlled by \fB\-f77=mixed\-common\fP option.

.TP
.I "Common block NAME: varying length"
For \fB\-common\fP setting level 2, this message means that
a COMMON block is declared to have different numbers of words in two
different subprograms.  A word is the amount of storage occupied by
one integer or real variable.
For \fB\-common\fP setting level 3, it means that the two declarations
have different numbers of variables, where an array of any size is
considered one variable.
This is not
necessarily an error, but it may indicate that a variable is missing
from one of the lists.  Note that according to the Fortran 77 Standard,
it is an error for named COMMON blocks (but not blank COMMON) to differ
in number of words in declarations in different modules.
Given for \fB\-common\fP setting 2 or 3.

.TP
.I "Error: Badly formed logical/relational operator or constant"
.TP
.I "Error: Badly formed real constant"
The syntax analyzer has found the start of
one of the special words that begin and
end with a period (e.g. \fC.EQ.\fR), or the start of a numeric constant,
but did not succeed in finding a complete item of that kind.

.TP
.I "Error: cannot be adjustable size in module NAME"
A character variable cannot be declared with a size that is an
asterisk in parentheses unless it is a dummy argument, a parameter, or
the name of the function defined in the module.

.TP
.I "Error: cannot be declared in SAVE statement in module NAME"
Only local variables and common blocks can be declared in a
\fCSAVE\fR statement.

.TP
.I "Error: No path to this statement"
\fBftnchek\fP will detect statements which are ignored or by-passed because
there is no foreseeable route to the statement.  For example, an
unnumbered statement (a statement without a statement label), occurring
immediately after a \fCGOTO\fR
statement, cannot possibly be executed.

.TP
.I "Error: Parse error"
This means that the parser, which analyzes the Fortran
program into expressions,
statements, etc., has been unable to find a valid interpretation for some
portion of a statement in the program.  If your compiler does not report a
syntax error at the same place, the most common explanations are: (1) use of an
extension to ANSI standard Fortran that is not recognized by
\fBftnchek\fP, or (2) the statement requires more lookahead than
\fBftnchek\fP uses (see section on Bugs).
.IP
NOTE: This message means that the affected statement is not interpreted.
Therefore, it is possible that \fBftnchek\fP's
subsequent processing will be in error, if it depends on any matters
affected by this statement (type declarations, etc.).

.TP
.I "Error: Syntax error"
This is the same as ``Error: Parse error'' (see above).  It is generated
if your version of \fBftnchek\fP was built using the UNIX \fByacc\fP
parser generator rather than GNU \fBbison\fP.

.TP
.I "Identifiers which are not unique in first six chars"
Warns that two identifiers which are longer than 6 characters do not
differ in the first 6 characters.  This is for portability: they may not
be considered distinct by some compilers.
Controlled by \fB\-sixchar\fP option.

.TP
.I "Nonportable usage: argument precision may not be correct for intrinsic function"
The precision of an argument passed to an intrinsic function may be
incorrect on some computers.  Issued when a numeric variable declared
with explicit precision (e.g.  \fCREAL*8 X\fR) is passed to a
specific intrinsic function (e.g. \fCDSQRT(X)\fR).
Controlled by \fB\-portability=mixed\-size\fP and \fB\-wordsize\fP.

.TP
.I "Nonportable usage: character constant/variable length exceeds 255"
Some compilers do not support character strings more than 255
characters in length.
Controlled by \fB\-portability=long\-string\fP.

.TP
.I "Nonportable usage: File contains tabs"
\fBftnchek\fP expands tabs to be equivalent to spaces up to the next column
which is a multiple of 8.  Some compilers treat tabs differently, and
also it is possible that files sent by electronic mail will have the tabs
converted to blanks in some way.  Therefore files containing tabs may not
be compiled correctly after being transferred.  \fBftnchek\fP does not give
this message if tabs only occur within comments or character constants.
Controlled by \fB\-portability=tab\fP.

.TP
.I "Nonportable usage: non-integer DO loop bounds"
This warning is only given when the \fCDO\fR index and bounds are
non-integer.
Use of non-integer quantities in a \fCDO\fR statement may cause
unexpected errors, or different results on different machines, due to
roundoff effects.
Controlled by \fB\-portability=real\-do\fP.

.TP
.I "Possibly it is an array which was not declared"
This message is appended to warnings related to
a function invocation or to an argument type
mismatch, for which the possibility exists that what appears to be a
function is actually meant to be an array.  If the programmer forgot to
dimension an array, references to the array will be interpreted as
function invocations.  This message will be suppressed if the name in
question appears in an \fCEXTERNAL\fR or \fCINTRINSIC\fR statement.
Controlled by the \fB\-novice\fP option.

.TP
.I "Possibly misleading appearance: characters past 72 columns"
The program is being processed with the statement field width at its
standard value of 72, and some nonblank characters have been found
past column 72.  In this case,
\fBftnchek\fP is not processing the characters past column 72, and is
notifying the user that the statement may not have the meaning that it
appears to have.  These characters might be intended by the programmer to be
significant, but they will be ignored by the compiler.  Controlled by
\fB\-pretty=long\-line\fP.

.TP
.I "Possibly misleading appearance: Common block declared in more than one statement"
Such multiple declarations are legal and have the same effect as
a continuation of the original declaration of the block.
This warning is only given if the two declarations are separated by
one or more intervening statements.
Controlled by \fB\-pretty=multiple\-common\fP.

.TP
.I "Possibly misleading appearance: Continuation follows comment or blank line"
\fBftnchek\fP issues this warning message to alert the user that a
continuation of a statement is interspersed with comments, making it easy
to overlook.
Controlled by \fB\-pretty=continuation\fP.

.TP
.I "Possibly misleading appearance: Extraneous parentheses"
Warns about parentheses surrounding a variable by itself in an
expression.  When a parenthesized variable is passed as an argument to
a subprogram, it is treated as an expression, not as a variable whose
value can be modified by the called routine.
Controlled by \fB\-pretty=parentheses\fP.

.TP
.I "Subprogram NAME: argument data type mismatch at position n"
The subprogram's
\fIn\fP-th actual argument (in the \fCCALL\fR or the
usage of a function) differs in datatype or precision from the \fIn\fP-th dummy
argument (in the \fCSUBROUTINE\fR or \fCFUNCTION\fR
declaration).  For instance, if the user defines a
subprogram by
.nf
\fC     SUBROUTINE SUBA(X)\fR
\fC     REAL X\fR
.fi
and elsewhere invokes \fCSUBA\fR by
.nf
\fC     CALL SUBA(2)\fR
.fi
.br
\fBftnchek\fP will detect the error.  The reason here
is that the number 2 is integer, not real.  The user should have written
.nf
\fC     CALL SUBA(2.0)\fR
.fi
.IP
When checking an argument which is a subprogram, \fBftnchek\fP must be
able to determine whether it is a function or a subroutine.  The rules
used by \fBftnchek\fP to do this are as follows: If the subprogram,
besides being passed as an actual argument, is also invoked directly
elsewhere in the same module, then its type is determined by that
usage.  If not, then if the name of the subprogram does not appear in
an explicit type declaration, it is assumed to be a subroutine; if it
is explicitly typed it is taken as a function.  Therefore, subroutines
passed as actual arguments need only be declared by an \fCEXTERNAL\fR
statement in the calling module, whereas functions must also be
explicitly typed in order to avoid generating this error message.
Controlled by \fB\-arguments\fP setting.

.TP
.I "Subprogram NAME: argument arrayness mismatch at position n"
Similar to the preceding situation, but
the subprogram dummy argument differs from the corresponding actual
argument in its number of dimensions or number of elements.
Controlled by \fB\-array\fP together with \fB\-arguments\fP settings.

.TP
.I "Subprogram NAME: argument mismatch at position n"
A character dummy argument is larger than the corresponding actual
argument, or a Hollerith dummy argument is larger than the
corresponding actual argument.  Controlled by \fB\-arguments\fP setting.

.TP
.I "Subprogram NAME: argument usage mismatch"
\fBftnchek\fP detects a possible conflict between the way a subprogram uses
an argument and the way in which the argument is supplied to the
subprogram.  The conflict can be one of two types, as outlined below.

.TP
.if n .ti +3
.if t .ti +.3i
.I "Dummy arg is modified, Actual arg is const or expr"
A dummy argument is an argument as named in a \fCSUBROUTINE\fR or
\fCFUNCTION\fR statement and used within the subprogram.  An actual
argument is an argument as passed to a subroutine or function by the
caller.  \fBftnchek\fP is saying that a dummy argument is modified by
the subprogram, implying that its value is changed in the calling module.
The corresponding actual argument should not be a constant or
expression, but rather a variable or array element which can be
legitimately assigned to.
Controlled by the \fB\-usage=arg\-const\-modified\fP option.

.TP
.if n .ti +3
.if t .ti +.3i
.I "Dummy arg used before set, Actual arg not set"
Here a dummy argument may be used in the subprogram
before having a value assigned to it by the subprogram.  The
corresponding actual argument should have a value assigned to it by the
caller prior to invoking the subprogram.
Controlled by the \fB\-usage=var\-uninitialized\fP option.
.IP
This warning is not affected by the \fB\-arguments\fP setting.

.TP
.I "Subprogram NAME invoked inconsistently"
Here the mismatch is between the datatype of the subprogram itself as
used and as defined. For instance, if the user declares
.nf
\fC     INTEGER FUNCTION COUNT(A)\fR
.fi
and invokes \fCCOUNT\fR in another module as
.nf
\fC     N = COUNT(A)\fR
.fi
.br
without declaring its datatype, it will default to real type, based on
the first letter of its name.  The calling module should have included
the declaration
.nf
\fC     INTEGER COUNT\fR
.fi
.IP
Given for \fB\-arguments\fP setting 2 or 3.

.TP
.I "Subprogram NAME:  varying length argument lists:"
An inconsistency has been found between the number of dummy arguments
(parameters) a subprogram has and the number of actual arguments given it
in an invocation.
\fBftnchek\fP keeps track of all invocations of subprograms
(\fCCALL\fR
statements and expressions using functions) and compares them with
the definitions of the subprograms elsewhere in the source code.  The
Fortran compiler normally does not catch this type of error.
Given for \fB\-arguments\fP setting 1 or 3.

.TP
.I "Variable not declared.  Type has been implicitly defined"
When printing the symbol table for a module,
\fBftnchek\fP will flag with an asterisk
all identifiers that are not explicitly typed

This provides support for users who wish to declare all variables as
is required in Pascal or some other languages.

.TP
.I "Variables declared but never referenced"
Detects any identifiers that were declared in your program but were
never used, either to be assigned a value or to have their value
accessed.  Variables in COMMON are excluded.
Controlled by the \fB\-usage=var\-unused\fP option.

.TP
.I "Variables set but never used"
\fBftnchek\fP will notify the user when a variable has been assigned a
value, but the variable is not otherwise used in the program.  Usually
this results from an oversight.
Controlled by the \fB\-usage=var\-set\-unused\fP option.

.TP
.I "Variables used before set"
This message indicates that an identifier is used to compute a value
prior to its initialization.  Such usage may lead to an incorrect value
being computed, since its initial value is not controlled.
Controlled by the \fB\-usage=var\-uninitialized\fP option.

.TP
.I "Variables may be used before set"
Similar to used before set except that \fBftnchek\fP is not able to
determine its status with certainty.  \fBftnchek\fP assumes a variable
may be used before set if the first usage of the variable occurs prior
in the program text to its assignment.
Controlled by the \fB\-usage=var\-uninitialized\fP option.

.TP
.I "Warning: DO index is not integer"
This warning is only given when the \fCDO\fR bounds are integer, but
the \fCDO\fR index is not.  It may indicate a failure to declare the
index to be an integer.
Controlled by \fB\-truncation=real\-do\fP option.

.TP
.I "Warning: integer quotient expr ... converted to real"
The quotient of two integers results in an integer type result, in
which the fractional part is dropped.  If such an integer expression
involving division is later converted to a real datatype, it may be that
a real type division had been intended.
Controlled by \fB\-truncation=int\-div\-real\fP option.

.TP
.I "Warning: Integer quotient expr ... used in exponent"
The quotient of two integers results in an integer type result, in
which the fractional part is dropped.  If such an integer expression
is used as an exponent, it is quite likely that a real type division was
intended.
Controlled by \fB\-truncation=int\-div\-exponent\fP option.

.TP
.I "Warning: NAME not set when RETURN encountered"
The way that functions in Fortran return a value is by assigning the
value to the name of the function.  This message indicates that the
function was not assigned a value before the point where a
\fCRETURN\fR statement was found.  Therefore it is possible that the
function could return an undefined value.

.TP
.I "Warning: Nonstandard syntax: adjustable size cannot be concatenated here"
The Fortran 77 Standard (sec. 6.2.2) forbids concatenating character variables
whose size is an asterisk in parentheses, except in an assignment
statement.   Controlled by \fB\-f77=mixed\-expr\fP.

.TP
.I "Warning: Nonstandard syntax : significant characters past 72 columns"
This warning is given under the \fB\-f77=long\-line\fP setting if the
\fB\-columns\fP setting has been used to increase the statement field width,
and a statement has meaningful program text beyond column 72.
Standard Fortran ignores all text in those columns, but some compilers
do not.  Thus the program may be treated differently by different
compilers.

.TP
.I "Warning: Nonstandard syntax : Statement out of order."
\fBftnchek\fP will detect statements that are out of the
sequence specified for ANSI standard Fortran 77.  Table 1 illustrates the
allowed sequence of statements in the Fortran language.  Statements which are
out of order are nonetheless interpreted by
\fBftnchek\fP,
to prevent ``cascades'' of error messages.
The sequence counter is also rolled back to prevent
repetition of the error message for a block of similar statements.
Controlled by the \fB\-f77=statement\-order\fP option.

.I "Warning: real truncated to intg"
\fBftnchek\fP has detected an assignment statement which has a real
expression on the right, but an integer variable on the left.  The
fractional part of the real value will be lost.  If you explicitly
convert the real expression to integer using the \fCINT\fR or
\fCNINT\fR intrinsic function, no warning will be printed.  A similar
message is printed if a double precision expression is assigned to a
single precision variable, etc.
Controlled by \fB\-truncation=demotion\fP option.

.TP
.I "Warning: subscript is not integer"
Since array subscripts are normally integer quantities, the use of a
non-integer expression here may signal an error.
Controlled by \fB\-truncation=real\-subscript\fP option.

.TP
.I "Warning: Unknown intrinsic function"
This message warns the user that a name declared in an
\fCINTRINSIC\fR statement is unknown to \fBftnchek\fP.  Probably it is
a nonstandard intrinsic function, and so the program will not be
portable.  The function will be treated by \fBftnchek\fP as a
user-defined function.  This warning is not suppressed by any
option, since it affects \fBftnchek\fP's analysis of
the program.  However, if the intrinsic function is in one of the
supported sets of nonstandard intrinsics, you can use the
\fB\-intrinsic\fP setting to cause \fBftnchek\fP to recognize it.

.SH "LIMITATIONS AND EXTENSIONS"

\fBftnchek\fP accepts ANSI standard Fortran-77 programs with some minor
limitations and numerous common extensions.
.TP
.BR  Limitations :
.RS
\fBftnchek\fP uses only one line of lookahead when
analyzing a program into its basic syntactic elements.  If a
particular statement is difficult to identify, it may be handled
improperly if the ambiguity is not resolved on a single line.  This
limitation applies to complex constants except in \fCDATA\fR
statements, and to situations in which a variable name might be
confused with a keyword.  For example, if the variable name
\fCWRITE\fR is used for an array, then a very long
statement assigning a value
to some element of this array could be mistaken as a \fCWRITE\fR
statement if the equals sign is not on the same line as the word
\fCWRITE\fR.
.PP
The dummy arguments in statement functions are treated like ordinary
variables of the program.  That is, their scope is the entire subprogram, not
just the statement function definition.
.PP
The checking of FORMAT statements is lax, tolerating missing separators
(comma, etc.) between format descriptors in places where the Standard
requires them, and allowing \fI.\|d\fP fields on descriptors that should
not have them.  It does warn under \fB\-f77=format\-edit\-descr\fP
about nonstandard descriptor types (like
\fCO\fR), and supported extensions.
.PP
If a user-supplied subprogram has the same name as one of the
nonstandard intrinsic functions recognized by \fBftnchek\fP, it must
be declared in an \fCEXTERNAL\fR statement in any routine that invokes
it.  Otherwise it will be subject to the checking normally given to
the intrinsic function.  Since the nonstandard intrinsics are not
standard, this \fCEXTERNAL\fR statement is not required by the Fortran
77 Standard.  Using the \fB\-intrinsic=none\fP setting, recognition of most
nonstandard intrinsics (excepting only those needed to support the
double complex data type) can be turned off.  See the lists of
supported nonstandard intrinsic functions under the discussion of the
\fB\-intrinsic\fP setting above.
.RE
.TP
.BR  Extensions :
.RS
All of these extensions (except lower-case characters) will generate
warnings if the relevant \fB\-f77\fP
option is set.
Some of the extensions listed below are part of the Fortran-90
Standard.  These are indicated by the notation (F90).
.PP
Tabs are permitted, and translated into equivalent blanks which correspond
to tab stops every 8 columns.  The standard does not recognize tabs.
Note that some compilers allow tabs, but treat them differently.  The
treatment defined for DEC FORTRAN can be achieved using the
\fB\-source=dec\-tab\fP setting.
.PP
Strings may be delimited by either quote marks or apostrophes.  A
sequence of two delimiter characters is interpreted as a single
embedded delimiter character.  (F90)
.PP
Strings may contain UNIX-style backslash escape sequences.  They will
be interpreted as such if the \fB\-source=unix\-backslash\fP setting is given.
Otherwise the backslash character will be treated as a normal
printing character.
.PP
Source code can be in either Fortran 90 free format or traditional fixed
format.  (F90)
.PP
A semicolon is allowed as a statement separator.  (F90)
.PP
Lower case characters are permitted, and are converted internally to
uppercase except in character strings.  The standard specifies upper case only,
except in comments and strings.  (F90)
.PP
Hollerith constants are permitted, in accordance with the Fortran 77
Standard, appendix C.  They should not be used in expressions, or confused
with datatype CHARACTER.
.PP
The letter 'D' (upper or lower case) in column 1 is treated as
the beginning of a comment.  There is no option to treat such lines as
statements instead of comments.
.PP
Statements may be longer than 72 columns provided that the setting
\fB\-columns\fP
was used to increase the limit.  According to the standard, all
text from columns 73 through 80 is ignored, and no line may be longer
than 80 columns.
.PP
Variable names may be longer than six characters.  The standard specifies
six as the maximum.  \fBftnchek\fP permits names up to 31 characters
long (F90).
.PP
Variable names may contain underscores and dollar signs (or other
non-alphabetic characters as specified by the
\fB\-identifier\-chars\fP option).  These characters are
are treated the same as alphabetic letters.  The default type
for variables beginning with these characters is REAL.
In IMPLICIT type statements specifying a range of characters,
the dollar sign follows Z and is followed by underscore.
(Any other user-defined characters are treated the same as the dollar sign.)
Fortran 90 permits underscores in variable names.
.PP
The UNIX version tolerates the presence of preprocessor directives,
namely lines beginning with the pound sign
(#).
These are treated as comments, except for
\fC#line\fR
directives, which are interpreted, and are used to set the line number
and source file name for warnings and error messages.  Note that
\fC#include\fR
directives are not processed by \fBftnchek\fP.  Programs that use them for
including source files should be passed through the preprocessor
before being input to \fBftnchek\fP.
As noted below, \fBftnchek\fP does process
\fCINCLUDE\fR statements, which have a different syntax.
An optional program, \fBftnpp\fP(1L) (available separately)
provides  preprocessing that properly handles
\fCINCLUDE\fR files.
.PP
The Fortran 90 \fCDO\fR ...  \fCENDDO\fR control structure is permitted.
The \fCCYCLE\fR and \fCEXIT\fR statements are accepted.  All of these may
have an optional do-construct name, but construct names are not checked for
consistency. (F90)
.PP
The Fortran 90 \fCSELECT CASE\fR construct is accepted. (F90)
.PP
Construct names are also accepted on \fCIF\fR, \fCTHEN\fR, \fCELSE\fR,
\fCENDIF\fR and \fCSELECT CASE\fR statements. (F90)
.PP
The \fCACCEPT\fR and \fCTYPE\fR statements (for terminal I/O) are
permitted, with the same syntax as \fCPRINT\fR.
.PP
The so-called ``Cray pointer'' syntax is tolerated. It is not the same as the
Fortran 90 \fCPOINTER\fR statement.  There is no real checking
of the statement other than basic syntax.
The form of this statement is
.br
.in +3
\fCPOINTER (\fR\fIpointer\fP\fC, \fR\fIpointee\fP\fC)\fR
[\fC,(\fR\fIpointer\fP\fC, \fR\fIpointee\fP\fC)\fR]
.in -3
.br
The pointer variables are assigned a data type of \fCINTEGER *4\fR.
Usage checking of the pointee variables is suppressed, since in
practice they are accessed indirectly via the pointers.
.PP
Statements may have any number of continuation lines.  The Fortran 77
and Fortran 90 standards allow a maximum of 19 in fixed source form.
The Fortran 90 standard allows a maximum of 39 in free source form.
.PP
Relational (comparison) operators composed of punctuation, namely: <
<= == /= > >= are allowed.  (F90)
.PP
Inline comments, beginning with an exclamation mark, are
permitted.  (F90)
.PP
NAMELIST I/O is supported.  The syntax is the same as in Fortran 90.
.PP
FORMAT statements can contain a dollar sign to indicate suppression of
carriage-return.
An integer expression enclosed in angle brackets can be used anywhere in a
FORMAT statement where
the Fortran 77 Standard allows an integer constant (except for the length of a
Hollerith constant),
to provide a run-time value for a repeat specification or field width.
.PP
Nonstandard keywords are allowed in I/O statements,
corresponding to those in VMS Fortran.
.PP
The \fCIMPLICIT NONE\fR statement is supported.  The meaning of this
statement is that all variables must have their data types explicitly
declared.  Rather than flag the occurrences of such variables with
syntax error messages, \fBftnchek\fP waits till the end of the module,
and then prints out a list of all undeclared variables,
as it does for the \fB\-declare\fP option.  (F90)
.PP
Data types \fCINTEGER\fR, \fCREAL\fR, \fCCOMPLEX\fR, and
\fCLOGICAL\fR are allowed to have an optional precision specification in
type declarations.  For instance, \fCREAL*8\fR means an 8-byte
floating point data type.  The \fCREAL*8\fR datatype is not
necessarily considered equivalent to \fCDOUBLE PRECISION\fR,
depending on the \fB\-wordsize\fP setting.
The Fortran 77 Standard allows
a length specification only for \fCCHARACTER\fR data.
.PP
\fBftnchek\fP supports the \fCDOUBLE\fR \fCCOMPLEX\fR type
specification for a complex quantity whose real and imaginary parts
are double precision.  Mixed-mode arithmetic involving
single-precision complex with double-precision real data,
prohibited under the Standard, yields a double complex result.
.PP
Combined type declarations and data-statement-like initializers are
accepted.  These have the form of a standard Fortran 77 type
declaration, followed by a slash-delimited list of constants like that
used in a \fCDATA\fR statement.  An example of the syntax is
.br
.in +5
\fCINTEGER  N / 100 /\fR
.in -5
.br
This bastard form of initializing declaration was not
adopted in Fortran 90.  Such declarations should be written using
the standard form described below, which is accepted by \fBftnchek\fP.
.PP
There is limited support for Fortran 90 attribute-based type
declarations.  This style of declaration is distinguished by the use
of a double colon (::) between the list of attributes and the list of
declared variables.  The features supported may be
adequate for novice programmers, but are not yet sufficient for
professional-quality Fortran 90 programs.  I hope to add
support for more features in future releases.  I invite volunteers to
assist in this task.  See the ToDo file in the source code
distribution for details.
The attributes currently accepted, besides all
the usual data types, are \fCDIMENSION\fR, \fCEXTERNAL\fR,
\fCINTRINSIC\fR, \fCPARAMETER\fR, and \fCSAVE\fR.  The new form of
declaration also allows assignment of values to the variables
declared.  At present, the \fC(LEN=\fIvalue\fC)\fR form of specifying
character lengths is also accepted.  Kind specifications, using
\fC(KIND=\fIvalue\fC)\fR are parsed but are not processed: all kinds
are treated as default kind.  Also, there is little checking of these
declarations beyond basic syntax.
.PP
Many commonly found nonstandard intrinsic functions are provided.  See
the discussion of \fB\-intrinsic\fP for a list of functions and how to
control which ones are recognized.
.PP
Argument checking is not tight for those nonstandard intrinsics
that take arrays or mixed argument types.
.PP
\fBftnchek\fP permits the \fCINCLUDE\fR statement, which causes
inclusion of the text of the given file.  The syntax is
.br
.in +5
\fCINCLUDE '\fR\fIfilename\fP\fC'\fR
.in -5
.br
This is compatible with Fortran 90.
If the \fB\-source=vms\-include\fP option is given, \fBftnchek\fP follows
VMS conventions with respect to this statement: it assumes a default
extension of \fI.\|for\fP if no filename extension is given, and
allows the qualifier \fC/[NO]LIST\fR following the filename, to
control the listing of the included file.  There is no support for
including VMS text modules.
.PP
In diagnostic output relating to items contained in include
files, the location of the error is specified by both
its location in the include file and the location in the parent file
where the file was included.
.PP
\fBftnchek\fP accepts \fCPARAMETER\fR statements which lack
parentheses.  These will be warned about if the
\fB\-f77=param\-noparen\fP flag is given.
.PP
\fBftnchek\fP accepts \fCPARAMETER\fR definitions that involve
intrinsic functions
and exponentiation by a non-integer exponent.  Both of these cases are
prohibited by the Fortran 77
Standard, and will be warned about if the \fB\-f77=param\-intrinsic\fP
flag is given.  If an intrinsic function value
is a compile-time integer constant,
\fBftnchek\fP will evaluate it.  This allows better checking if the
parameter is used in declaring array sizes.  Fortran 90 allows
intrinsic functions in \fCPARAMETER\fR definitions.
.PP
The intrinsic functions that are evaluated are:
\fC
.TS
center;
l l l l l.
ABS	IABS	DIM	IDIM	MAX
MAX0	MIN	MIN0	MOD	SIGN
ISIGN	LEN	ICHAR	INDEX
.TE
\fR
.br
The functions of integer arguments are evaluated only if the arguments
are integer constant expressions.  (These may involve integer
constants, parameters, and evaluated intrinsic functions.)  The
function \fCLEN\fR is evaluated if its argument is an expression
involving only character constants and variables whose length is not
adjustable.  The functions \fCICHAR\fR and \fCINDEX\fR are evaluated
only if the arguments are character constants.  \fBftnchek\fP gives a
warning if it needs the value of some intrinsic function that is not
evaluated.

for same.
.TP
6.
Fixed a bug in checking type agreement between variables and their
initial values in Fortran 90-style declarations with initializers, as
in \fCINTEGER :: N=100\fR.
.TP
7.
New error message when an internal file is a constant rather than a
variable.  Some compilers permit this for \fCREAD\fR operations, but
it is prohibited by the F90 Standard in section 9.2.2.1.
.PP
Here are the changes from Version 3.0 to Version 3.1:
.TP \w'1.'u+2n
1.
New checks for proper nesting of block structures such as \fCIF\fR ...
\fCEND IF\fR.
.TP
2.
Limited support for attribute-based type declarations.  Read the
section on Extensions for details.  Note that this new feature should
be seen as a first step toward full support for Fortran 90 type
declarations, but it is not there yet.  The level of support may be
sufficient for novice programmers, but it is not yet ready for serious
use.
.TP
3.
New flag \fB\-style\fP for users who want to adhere to a strict
modern programming style.  This flag controls warnings about legal
Fortran 77 constructs such as \fCGOTO\fR that are more error-prone
than the newer constructs available in Fortran 90.
.TP
4.
The \fB\-source\fP options \fBparameter\-implicit\-type\fP and
\fBdec\-parameter\-standard\-type\fP were changed to
\fBparam\-implicit\-type\fP and \fBdec\-param\-standard\-type\fP
respectively for consistency with other options also related to
parameters, which all use \fBparam\-\fP.
.TP
5.
New warnings: modification of a DO variable inside its loop (controlled by
\fB\-usage=do\-index\-modified\fP option), and alternate return using
a constant value that does not correspond to a label argument
(controlled by a new \fB\-pretty=alternate\-return\fP option).
.TP
6.
Fixed a bug that caused project files to contain incorrect information
about actual arguments that are parameters.  This bug had no effect on
checking of programs using the project files, since the bogus information
was not used in these cases.
.TP
7.
The \fB\-project\fP flag now takes options to control how much
information about subprogram calls and common blocks should be
stored.  These options are mainly of interest to those who want to use
project files for purposes other than checking the program with
\fBftnchek\fP.

Changed the way that the HTML documentation is produced.  The main
change is that URLs referring to man pages have a different form.
Also got rid of the symbolic links in the html directory, which cause

.SH "BUGS"
\fBftnchek\fP still has much room for improvement.
Your feedback is appreciated.  We want to know about any bugs you notice.
Bugs include not only cases in which \fBftnchek\fP issues an error message
where no error exists, but also if \fBftnchek\fP fails to issue a warning when
it ought to.  Note, however, that \fBftnchek\fP is not intended to catch all
syntax errors (see section on Limitations).
Also, it is not considered a bug for a variable to be
reported as used before set, if the reason is that the usage of the
variable occurs prior in the text to where the variable is set.  For
instance, this could occur when a \fCGOTO\fR causes execution to loop backward
to some previously skipped statements.  \fBftnchek\fP does not analyze the
program flow, but assumes that statements occurring earlier in the text
are executed before the following ones.
.PP
We especially want to know if \fBftnchek\fP crashes for any reason.  It is
not supposed to crash, even on programs with syntax errors.  Suggestions
are welcomed for additional features which you would find useful.  Tell
us if any of \fBftnchek\fP's
messages are incomprehensible.  Comments on the
readability and accuracy of this document are also welcome.
.PP
You may also suggest support for additional extensions to the
Fortran language.  These will be included only if it is felt that the
extensions are sufficiently widely accepted by compilers.
.PP
If you find a bug in \fBftnchek\fP,
first consult the list of known bugs
below to see if it has already been reported.  Also check the section
entitled ``Limitations and Extensions'' above for restrictions
that could be causing the problem.  If you do not find the problem

Highest priority will be given to bugs which cause \fBftnchek\fP to crash.
.PP
Certain problems that arise when checking large programs can be fixed
by increasing the sizes of the data areas in \fBftnchek\fP.  (These
problems are generally signaled by error messages beginning with ``Oops''.)
The simplest way to increase the table sizes is by
recompiling \fBftnchek\fP with the \fCLARGE_MACHINE\fR macro name
defined.  Consult the \fCmakefile\fR and \fCREADME\fR file for the
method of doing this.
.PP
The following is a list of known bugs.
.TP \w'1.'u+2n
1.
Bug: Used-before-set message is suppressed for any variable which
is used as the loop index in an implied-do loop, even if it was in
fact used before being set in some earlier statement.
For example, consider \fCJ\fR in the statement
.RS
.PP
.nf
\fC      WRITE(5,*) (A(J), J=1,10)\fR
.fi
.PP
Here \fBftnchek\fP parses the I/O expression,
\fCA(J)\fR, where \fCJ\fR is used, before it parses the implied loop
where \fCJ\fR is set.  Normally this would cause
\fBftnchek\fP to report a spurious used-before-set warning for \fCJ\fR.
Since this report is usually in error and occurs fairly commonly,
\fBftnchek\fP suppresses the warning for \fCJ\fR altogether.
.PP
Prognosis: A future version of  \fBftnchek\fP is planned which will handle
implied-do loops correctly.
.RE
.TP
2.
Bug: Variables used (not as arguments) in statement-function
subprograms do not have their usage status updated when the statement
function is invoked.

Bug: VAX version does not expand wildcards in filenames on the
command line if they are followed without space by an option, e.g.
\fCftnchek *.f/calltree\fR would not expand the \fC*.f\fR.
This is because VMS-style options without intervening
space are not supported by the GNU \fCshell_mung\fR routine that is used
to expand wildcards.

.SH "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS"
\fBftnchek\fP
was designed by Dr. Robert Moniot, professor at Fordham
University.  During the academic year of
1988-1989, Michael Myers and Lucia Spagnuolo developed the program to
perform the variable usage checks.  During the following year it was
augmented by Lois Bigbie to check subprogram arguments and
COMMON block declarations.
Brian Downing assisted with the implementation of the \fCINCLUDE\fR
statement.
John Quinn wrote the common block usage checks.
Heba Elsayed wrote the label table printout and label usage checks.
Nelson H. F. Beebe of the University of Utah added most of the new code
to implement the \fB\-makedcls\fP feature and wrote the dcl2inc script.
The \fB\-mkhtml\fP feature was contributed by Mark McVeigh of
Framatome ANP, Inc.
The \fB\-reference\fP feature was contributed by Gerome Emmanuel,
Ecole des mines, U. Nancy (slightly modified).

was contributed by Dr. Philip Rubini of Cranfield University, UK.
The support for Cray pointer syntax was provided by John Dannenhoffer of
United Technologies Research Center.
John C. Bollinger of Indiana University added the parser syntax for
the \fCSELECT CASE\fR construct.
Additional features will be added as time permits.
As of Version 2.5, the name was changed from \fBforchek\fP to \fBftnchek\fP,
to avoid confusion with a
similar program named \fBforcheck\fP,
developed earlier at Leiden University.

.BR uncompress (1)
utility.  If the file extension is \fI.\|gz\fP, uncompress with the
GNU
.BR gunzip (1L)
program.  Then use
.BR tar (1)
to unpack the files into a subdirectory.

document, created during installation of \fBftnchek\fP, is named
.IR ftnchek.\|1 .
The distribution also includes a plain ASCII version named
.IR ftnchek.\|doc ,
a PostScript version named
.IR ftnchek.\|ps ,
an HTML version in directory
.IR html ,
and a VMS HELP version named
.IR ftnchek.\|hlp .
