# Extract COMMON block declarations from .dcl files output by ftnchek
# 2.8.2 (or later), and provided that they are unique, output *.inc include
# files, and modified .dcl files with extension .dcn containing INCLUDE
# statements in place of COMMON block declarations.  In addition, write
# a sorted list of include file dependencies on stdout for adding to a
# Makefile.
#
# Usage:
#	ftnchek -makedcls=1 *.f
#	dcl2inc *.dcl
#
# You can then manually replace the old declarations in the *.f files
# with the contents of each corresponding *.dcn file.  Any COMMON
# blocks that are not identical to their first occurrence will be left
# intact, instead of being replaced by INCLUDE statements, and a
# warning will be issued for each of them.
